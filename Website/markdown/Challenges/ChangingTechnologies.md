[Changing Technologies]{style="font-size:22pt;font-weight:600"}

Network delivery speeds to the home have increased 10 fold over the past
10 years. Home storage capabilities have increased 1000 fold over the
same time period. Mobile phones [have]{style="font-weight:600"} become
the true converged ubiquitous computing platforms, with gigabytes of
storage, 3D visual capabilities, and video/audio recording and playback.

\> media consumption devices

Computers [have]{style="font-weight:600"} shrunk to laptops, intelligent
displays, pen and touch screens. Home entertainment platforms have gone
from multichannel TV with simple computer games to near interactive 3D
movies, gesture based input, surround sound audio and entire collections
of video fitting inside ring binder sized wallets.

There is currently reason to believe that these trends will continue
over the next 10 years. Home network delivery speeds will continue to
rise relatively slowly, but at least 10 fold. Storage may continue to
grow at a rate of1000 fold per decade. Incredible as this seems today,
this means that even a laptop may be capable of storing dozens of
terabytes.

Devices will continue to become more personal, and current esoteric
platforms, such as paper with e-ink may become more common. Connectivity
to and from these devices will become faster, more convenient and
movement of data between devices will be an
[expectation]{style="font-weight:600"}, not a privilege. If content
providers do not enable this, the people will enable it for themselves,
sharing their results.

3D interactive capabilities of \"games\" consoles will become film
quality, leading to an escalation of format wars leading beyond 2D
gesture capabilities to full 3D resolution and scene recognition. Camera
integration is leading to video phone style systems becoming common
place, very soon. Speech recognition will become common place.
Audio/Video search will take on a brute force approach, supplementing
and often replacing metadata approaches of the past.
