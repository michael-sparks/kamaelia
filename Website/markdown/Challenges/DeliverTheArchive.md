[Deliver The Archive?]{style="font-size:24pt;font-weight:600"}

The BBC audio archive comprises of 500,000 hours of audio. At bit rates
for an iPod this is a mere 27TB of storage. In terms of
[current]{style="font-style:italic"} technology this would fit on
commodity disk stores which could sit under a desk. In terms of solid
state storage - you\'d need 27,000 MMC cards. In practice that means 1
cubic foot of storage. Using video bit rates used for the Olympics
you\'re talking either 3 desks for disk based storage, or 1 shelf full
for solid state.

Clearly these bit rates are not suitable for archival and would be
inappropriate for television production. The idea that even the entire
BBC archive could fit in most people\'s homes today is a startling one.

If the amount of the archive the BBC chose to make available was as much
as 10%, then it becomes realistic for the audience to download now,
choose later - even on a laptop - if storage continues to increase as
projected.

In this world it makes more sense to deliver the content available en
masse to the entire audience than it does to pick and choose. Obviously
there are technical hurdles to jump over in achieving this, but
conversely having the content almost everywhere massively simplifies
this distribution. We allow the network and users to populate the
network. It seems inefficient to force the audience to return to the BBC
for content when they will be able to locally store all the content we
make available.

At this point in time the question then becomes not \"how do we serve
millions of concurrent streams\", but rather \"how do we ensure that we
populate the millions of storage devices out there?\"

[Challenge:]{style="font-weight:600"} How do we deliver a BBC
repository, dozens of Terabytes in size, to every home in the UK,
regularly refreshed, in a way that copes with disk failures and data
loss.
