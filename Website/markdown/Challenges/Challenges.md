[Deliver The Archive?]{style="font-size:24pt;font-weight:600"}

[Challenge:]{style="font-weight:600"} How do we deliver a BBC
repository, dozens of Terabytes in size, to every home in the UK,
regularly refreshed, in a way that copes with disk failures and data
loss.

[Content Sharing]{style="font-size:24pt;font-weight:600"}

[Challenge:]{style="font-weight:600"} Provide systems, acceptable to
this mature audience. Systems that foster this culture, but
[ensuring]{style="font-style:italic;font-weight:600"} that people are
still paid for producing content, whilst recognising that the audience
will create a lot of content themselves.

[Proprietary Past, Open Future]{style="font-size:24pt;font-weight:600"}

[Challenge:]{style="font-weight:600"} Open [systems
]{style="font-style:italic"}for media delivery must made to scale to
very large scale unidirectional streaming, or else many of the other
visions in this document falter.

[P2P and Multicast, Together]{style="font-size:24pt;font-weight:600"}

[Challenges: ]{style="font-weight:600"}We need to build new
Collaborative ClientHub protocols, allowing integration between
broadcast, multicast, P2P systems and our archives. P2P and multicast
systems need to be adapted to allow and take advantage of thousands of
P2P sources becoming simultaneously active. Security mechanisms such
that the audience can trust content is a key issue in such a system.

[Who\'s Free Lunch is Over?]{style="font-size:24pt;font-weight:600"}

[Challenge:]{style="font-weight:600"} Create a usable system for
producing parallel software systems that promotes reuse, resilience,
scales on new concurrent hardware platforms, and due to design naturally
encourages the design of parallel software systems.

[Moore\'s Law at Home vs Desire for
Quality]{style="font-size:24pt;font-weight:600"}

[Challenge:]{style="font-weight:600"} To find a way of capping the
[need]{style="font-style:italic"} for bandwidth usage on the client end.
This may mean that research into higher quality video in smaller and
smaller bit rates becomes ever more important to allow the BBC to remove
Moore\'s law from the client side of the equation.
