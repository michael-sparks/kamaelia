[Summary]{style="font-size:24pt;font-weight:600"}

The key aim is to pull people\'s awareness towards specific key problems
which are thought to be very difficult, but achievable in a decade or
two.

The sheer scale and scope of the problems caused by 20-60 million
different items of content to be viewed
[simultaneously]{style="font-style:italic"} from the BBC, potentially
online is a challenge that should be undertaken, but should not be
undertaken lightly.

There [are]{style="font-style:italic"} BBC projects underway looking at
these challenges, but the scope of this document is larger. The
challenges laid out in this document will exist, and need resolving -
whether the BBC does it or asks industry to help. Clearly the ultimate
solution will be a mix of both in areas of appropriate expertise.

[Meeting Challenges]{style="font-size:22pt;font-weight:600"}

BBC R&D projects exist that seek to address some of the issues laid out
here. The [Kamaelia](http://kamaelia.sourceforge.net/) &
[Dirac](http://dirac.sourceforge.net/) projects are aimed specifically
at the some of the challenges in this document. BBC and Industry
collaborations such as [Share
It!](http://www.hitech-projects.com/euprojects/share_it/) have been
looking at issues related to these challenges. Some of these challenges
naturally fit elsewhere with other groups.

However, the reality is that the BBC and industry cannot assume that the
public will follow. P2P has shown that the Internet Community - that is
anyone competent, willing and connected to the network - will go their
own way if the public is not involved. There is almost always a better
way.

The style of this document is inspired by the \"[Grand Challenges in
Computing](http://www.bcs.org/BCS/Awards/Events/GrandChallenges/conferencereports.htm)\"
documents produced by UK Academia. These grand challenges have a long
history. One notable success in recent times has been the Human Genome
Project. A project that was successful at driving forward state of the
art, but that which ultimately failed in it\'s original goal was
Hilbert\'s Grand Challenge to Mathematics around 1900.
