[Who\'s Free Lunch is Over?]{style="font-size: 24pt; font-weight: 600;"}

Moore\'s law was formulated by Intel\'s Gordon Moore in 1965 and
suggested that the number of transistors in a given area would double
every 18 months. He was right, and the observation prompted many
analogies in other areas - including raw CPU speed. This held true and
developers could gain speed as a \"free lunch\" simply by waiting.

\
\> The Free Lunch is Over\

Moore\'s law has ended in terms of raw CPU power as measured in raw
clock speed. Developers can no longer expect performance gains by simply
waiting. CPU manufacturers are utilising the old maxim of \"many hands
make light work\", and moving to highly parallel architectures. This
includes home systems like Sony\'s Playstation 3 which features 9 CPUs
inside a single chip.

Software must be written with parallel systems in mind, changing
dramatically the way it is produced. Whilst this is not a problem
directly for the audience, this does affect the BBC\'s long term ability
to deliver online.

Taking advantage of these CPUs requires specially designed software.
Parallel computing is considered by many as difficult - which needs to
change, since in a few years parallel systems will be common, and the
BBC will need maximise the use these systems. Online delivery is a
naturally highly parallel activity, and so is needs amongst the earliest
to benefit after the change.

[Challenge:]{style="font-weight: 600;"} Create a usable system for
producing parallel software systems that promotes reuse, resilience,
scales on new concurrent hardware platforms, and due to design naturally
encourages the design of parallel software systems.
