[Proprietary Past, Open Future]{style="font-size:24pt;font-weight:600"}

Online audio/video delivery has taken 3 forms to date. Traditional media
has [largely]{style="font-style:italic"} chosen to use systems from
either Microsoft or Real, with a small subset choosing systems from
Apple and others. More niche but highly profitable companies have
explored sealed Java applets or simple media download over HTTP. All
have found their content \"leaks\" onto private sharing systems, often
based on P2P technologies.

By and large however, the proprietary
[systems]{style="font-style:italic;font-weight:600"} - consisting of
closed protocols, codecs, players and servers are well known for
producing systems that currently deliver the goods as far as online AV
delivery is concerned. Even so these systems deal with thousands, not
millions.

Proprietary server systems essentially use a mechanism for charging that
boils down to audience size. A physical server can handle a fixed
maximum number of listeners or viewers. Charging per server essentially
penalises popularity.

Increasing the audience to millions from thousands is a 1000 fold
increase. Whilst system providers would jump at such a financial
opportunity. However, it is not reasonable to increase costs to the
license fee payer 1000 fold.

At present, proprietary systems fail to provide the BBC any way of
mitigating costs. Open systems based on open standards often replace the
early adopted proprietary systems, simply in order to scale. This has
been likened to proprietary medicines being replaced by generic drugs
over time.

Aspects impacting any new standards would include: agility in adopting
new video formats that come into existence every day; ability to switch
from streaming to downloading; ability to switch from single source to
multiple sources.

very large scale unidirectional streaming, or else many of the other
visions in this document falter.
