[Foreword]{style="font-size:24pt;font-weight:600"}

Welcome!

The past 30 years have been an exciting time in entertainment
technologies, network research, and online delivery. With the stealth
rise of ubiquitous computing through mobile phones; the shrinking of the
planet by audio and video conferencing via instant messaging;
democratisation of news, knowledge and opinion reporting via wikis and
blogs, the future appears to be even more exciting.

In [[Building Public
Value]{style="font-style:italic"}](http://www.bbc.co.uk/thefuture/bpv/prologue.shtml),
the BBC has committed to the delivery of BBC content to the British
Public over this multitude of systems, in a way that is enjoyable,
accessible and repurposable by the British Public in the way they
choose.

Whilst this is an exciting and intriguing future, this does require a
new evolution in the way large media such as video, and audio are
stored, and delivered. This document explores this vision, and suggests
a number of key challenges that need to be addressed along the way.
These are however only the first steps into the 21st century that we are
taking. In order to take the next steps we must meet these challenges
head on, resolve to solve them and move forward. Our view is that this
is a challenge that needs to be met in participation with industry and
the community.

[Feedback ?]{style="font-size:16pt;font-weight:600"}

[Please leave feedback
here.](http://kamaelia.sourceforge.net/cgi-bin/blog/blog.cgi?rm=addpostcomment&postid=1122837980)

Feedback isn\'t instantly published, mainly to combat spam, but will
appear, within 24 hours, usually and will be very welcome! We obviously
don\'t expect agreement in all areas, and indeed different opinions are
very welcome. You\'ll also note that we largely talk about delivery and
access versus navigation.

Clearly, if you\'re interested in working with us on any of these areas,
whoever you are, we\'re very interested in talking to you.
