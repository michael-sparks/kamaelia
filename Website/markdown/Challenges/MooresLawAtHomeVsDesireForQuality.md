[Moore\'s Law at Home vs Desire for
Quality]{style="font-size:24pt;font-weight:600"}

The growth in network upload capacity for servers will help mitigate BBC
distribution costs from a central location. However growth in download
capacity by our audience\'s tumbling costs will wipe out any savings.

Traditionally the BBC has aimed to send the best quality audio and video
services that the user can receive. Over dialup we provided video at
download speeds that fit over a dialup. For the Olympics - we assumed
that broadband users have 10 times that capacity. As a result we
provided video 10 times larger and much closer to the casual observer to
digital TV quality (10 times more on both sides).

In years to come home download speeds will grow 10 fold. Our audience
will be able and expect to, receive HDTV quality video over broadband.
Likewise the BBC will also want to deliver this quality. Upload capacity
would need to grow 10 fold again, [simply to service the current
audience size - eliminating savings in upload costs for the older poorer
quality.]{style="font-style:italic"}

As every person buying broadband knows - greater capacity costs more.
Simply changing from 2-4 million streams [per
day]{style="font-style:italic"} to 2-4 million users [per
second]{style="font-style:italic"} means our upload capacity means costs
to the license fee payer grow dramatically. Grow that 10 fold again, and
you get a very large number indeed!

Since Moore\'s law doesn\'t really help us, any work we can do to reduce
the need for users to user their full download capacity saves us money.
Reducing the bandwidth required for HDTV quality video will enable the
BBC to provide the audience with higher quality video using a flexible,
scalable approach.

[Challenge:]{style="font-weight:600"} To find a way of capping the
[need]{style="font-style:italic"} for bandwidth usage on the client end.
This may mean that research into higher quality video in smaller and
smaller bit rates becomes ever more important to allow the BBC to remove
Moore\'s law from the client side of the equation.
