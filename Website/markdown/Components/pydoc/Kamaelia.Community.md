[Kamaelia.Community](/Components/pydoc/Kamaelia.Community.html){.reference}
is the area of the released Kamaelia namespace owned by the community.
We have a packaging mechanism which simplifies the process of adding
your code here. The sub-name spaces are owned by specific individuals.
If you want a namespace, let use know and we\'ll reserve it for you in
here.

The naming here follows directories already created in /Sketches in the
non-released namespace.
