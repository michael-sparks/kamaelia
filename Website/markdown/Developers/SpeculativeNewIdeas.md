New Ideas ? 
===========

Specutaltive new are always interesting, and would probably start out as
sketches for things which could be useful. Componentising certain sorts
of things can be a very useful endevour since they can then be reused
with all the other components. Kamaelia\'s architecture was itself once
a speculative new idea - it\'s panned out really quite well, so where
would like to see things go next ?\
\
It\'s probably worth pulling out ideas from the GSOC pages into here.\
\
Starter for 10: How could these be intergrated?\

**Inference engine integration & componentisation** :
<http://pyclips.sourceforge.net/web/> -
[PyCLIPS](http://pyclips.sourceforge.net/web/) is an extension module
for the [Python language](http://python.org/ "Python Web Site") that
embeds full [CLIPS](http://clipsrules.sourceforge.net/ "CLIPS Web Site")
functionality in [Python](http://python.org/) applications. This means
that you can provide [Python](http://python.org/ "Python Web Site") with
a strong, reliable, widely used and well documented inference engine.

**Neural network systems integration** : <http://leenissen.dk/fann/> -
Fast Artificial Neural Network Library is a free open source neural
network library, which implements multilayer artificial neural networks
in C with support for both fully connected and sparsely connected
networks. ([python
bindings](http://leenissen.dk/fann/html/files2/installation-txt.html#Python_Bindings))

**Common sense engine/systems** : eg
[ConceptNet](http://web.media.mit.edu/%7Ehugo/conceptnet/) - ConceptNet
is a freely available commonsense knowledgebase and
natural-language-processing toolkit which supports many practical
textual-reasoning tasks over real-world documents right out-of-the-box
(without additional statistical training) including topic-jisting,
affect-sensing, analogy-making, text summarization, contextual
expansion, causal projection, cold document classification. (part of
MIT\'s [common sense](http://openmind.media.mit.edu/)
[project](http://openmind.media.mit.edu/Beginners.htm))

**Axon 2.0** : 

-   Make microprocesses and components mixinable.  This way, you can mix
    and match functionality when implementing pieces of a Kamaelia/Axon
    system.  [Mail
    thread](http://groups.google.com/group/kamaelia/browse_thread/thread/57602d58e050ebc4)
-   Implement sub-graphlines (better name needed!) as a way to make
    creating and linking subcomponents less tedious and more human
    readable.  [Mail
    thread](http://groups.google.com/group/kamaelia/t/8c0eabd1e3ea498b)\

etc :)

(add more!)\
