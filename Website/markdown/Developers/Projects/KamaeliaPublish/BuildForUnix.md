Developers/Projects/KamaeliaPublish/BuildForUnix
================================================

This page describes the process for getting the current KamaeliaPublish
source and building an executable for Unix OSes. This executable SHOULD
work for all Unix-like operating systems with python 2.3 or greater. The
executable has been verified to work on both OS X and Linux.

### Creating the executable 

1.  cd
    \$KAMAELIA\_SVN\_DIR/branches/private\_JMB\_DescartesComponentsAdded/Apps/Kamaelia-Publish
2.  ./make-unix.sh
3.  Look in the dist directory for your new Unix Executable!
