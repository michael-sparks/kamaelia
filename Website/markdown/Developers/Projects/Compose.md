Project Task Page: Compose
==========================

::: {.boxright}
**Status:** Stasis - Compose can create Graphline based Kamaelia
systems\
**Current Developers:** Michael\
**Current \"inflight\" dev location:**
/Code/Python/Kamaelia/Tools/Compose\*\
**Start Date:** August 2005\
**Expected End Date:** n/a\
**End Date:** na\
**Date this page last updated:** 12 December 2006\
**Estimated effort so far:** 20 days (est)\

**Description**
---------------

Compose will be a tool capable of visually composing and editting any
Kamaelia system.\
\
As Compose is created/improved, it will be capable of creating more and
more complex Kamaelia based systems visually. The outcome will be a tool
for generic systems, but especially networked & multimedia
applications.\
\
The potential for a graphical tool has been recognised all along, and
care has been taken in the design of Axon to allow this to happen, and
to ensure that any running system structure is introspectable at
runtime. Indeed, first came the system, then introspection, then visual
creation. Any extensions to the system (eg for non-dataflow components)
are suggested to follow the same mould - text/introspectable first,
graphical second.\
\
Benefits:\

A graphical tool provides for rapid prototyping

There is the potential for a generic \"spreadsheet of applications\"

There is the potential to build versions with a targeted interfaces for
different user types:

-   Non-technical BBC users
-   Technical BBC users
-   Children

As a debugging tool, the ability to visually delve inside a running
system and fix things (much like opening the hood of a car) is an
extremely interesting prospect - especially if this can be done in a
sustainable, maintainable way.\

Outputs
-------

### Expected

Expected outputs are likely to be iterative. This page is
non-exaustive.\

-   A tool for visualising Kamaelia systems
-   A tool for introspecting running Kamaelia systems
-   A tool for creating Kamaelia pipelines
-   A tool for creating Kamaelia graphlines
-   A tool for creating Kamaelia graphlines and setting up any necessary
    initial configuration code\
-   A tool for turning such graphlines and config code into reusable
    components themselves (eg for insertion into a shared repository)
-   A tool for creating new, based components textually and inserting
    them into a repository
-   \...\

### Actual

-   Axon Visualiser - in the Kamaelia 0.2 release
-   Visual Pipe Builder - in the Kamaelia 0.4 release
-   Compose 1.0 - graphline editor - in the Kamaelia 0.5 release
