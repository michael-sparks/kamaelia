# Wiki - no more

Back in the day, it was common to create websites using a wiki as a CMS.
This site used to do this so, so this page, previously documented how to do
this.

These days, this site is statically generated HTML from markdown files,
which are managed via git. This isn't to say this will always be the case,
but that's what is currently being done/changed to (as of Feb 2024).

If you're arriving here from another page, expecting a wiki to be here,
apologies, and [could you file an issue please?](https://github.com/sparkslabs/kamaelia/issues)
