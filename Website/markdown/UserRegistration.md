**Registration**
================

We need the following information to register you!\
\
OK, or we would if user registration was active yet. Currently it
isn\'t, but leaving the hook in because we aim to activate this later.
The idea is that it should be there to help support you with your
Kamaelia projects :) (given Kamaelia\'s component nature, most kamaelia
based projects end up consisting on lots of parts which can be reused in
other completely different projects)\
