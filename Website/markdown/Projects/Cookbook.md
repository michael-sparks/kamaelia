**Description**
---------------

Ongoing online documentation on the kamaelia website providing
\'recipes\' and tutorials on how to achieve particular goals.\
\
Code fragments will usually consitute examples in the
/Code/Python/Kamaelia/Examples/ part of the codebase.\
\
The aim is to provide a resource from which users can learn how to
achieve things using Kamaelia and gain overview and familiarity with the
system and its capabilities.\
\
This is an ongoing aspect of the more general need to document and the
project accessible to potential developers and users. There is therefore
no defined end point.\
