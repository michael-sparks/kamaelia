[7 Summary]{style="font-size:14pt;font-weight:600"}

This tutorial has hopefully helped you build a core component system
based on Kamaelia\'s Axon. It should be clear as well from this that the
core of Kamaelia is actually quite small. We\'ve found a number of
aspects which we can optimise, add in syntactic sugar, and we\'re
discovering that certain facilities are needed, and can be useful.
However the raw core is simple - it\'s about generators communicating
with inboxes and outboxes, and then building interesting systems on top
of that.

The next step we\'d normally recommend at this point is to build some
interesting systems. Some exercises which will hopefully be helpful will
appear as time progresses.
