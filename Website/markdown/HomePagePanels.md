### Kamaelia based systems

 \
:::

### [Kamaelia Grey](/KamaeliaGrey.html)

Spam reduction through greylisting. Kamaelia Grey is a SMTP proxy for
your inbound email, rejecting email likely to be spam. Mail likely to
not be spam is forwarded to your normal mail server.

### [Batch Transcoder](/ActiveFileProcessor.html)

This watches directories for new images and videos to transcode to
formats suitable for the web. You can think of it as the backend needed
for a youtube/flickr type site. PDF support is likely to be added soon.

### [Whiteboard](/Whiteboard.html)

A collaborative whiteboard. 2 or more machines share a display you can
write on - either can be a server. Whiteboards are paginated, and
therefore can also be used for remote presentations. Really cool with a
tablet.

### [ER Modeller](/ERModeller.html)

Built to allow modelling a database. You describe the entities and their
attributes, and relationships. Also allows entities to inherit from each
other. Uses a customised topology visualiser to show you your design.

### [Macro](/KamaeliaMacro.html)

Records and transcodes digital TV for later viewing (ie timeshifting).
It can do this for as many channels at once as you have CPU power and
tuners available for it.

Kamaelia Documentation
----------------------

### Build & improve Kamaelia based systems

 \
:::

### Documentation

Documentation is a core asset in Kamaelia. It is continuously being
extended and improved.

### [Tutorials](/Tutorials.html)

-   Dive into [Kamaelia tutorials from a variety of perspectives](/Tutorials.html)
-   See the [presentations given publicly](/Presentations.html)
-   Download and [read articles & publications about Kamaelia](/Publications.html)

### [Cookbook](/Cookbook.html)

This section contains a number of recipes showing how to build a variety
of different types of Kamaelia systems. Sections include:

-   Linking components together
-   Building Network systems, clients, servers, IM, etc
-   Building Digital TV systems
-   Building Multimedia systems
-   Using Kamaelia components & subsystems in non-kamaelia systems.

**More recipes always welcome.**

### [Component Reference](/Components.html)

Full component reference. This is automatically generated **nightly**,
and where tests exist, the output of the tests is parsed and included on
these pages.\

### [Axon Reference](/Docs/Axon/Axon.html)

Full reference for Axon - the core of Kamaelia. This is also

### Kamaelia is open source, help us improve it!

### [Developer Central](/Developers/)

Interested in helping out? You\'re more than welcome! In this area
you\'ll find some pages which cover some areas of interest for ongoing
dev, our general development process, project management process,
guidelines on contributing (eg smart questions, through to code, and
contributor agreements)

### [Get Help (Contact)](/Contact.html)

Sometimes the best contributions happen when someone asks the right
question. Please don\'t be afraid to ask (or answer!) questions. We\'d
love to help you, and merely ask that you help others in return. Not
much of a community otherwise? :) (OK, not everyone has time to do that)
Find us on [email](/mailinglists.html), [google groups](http://groups.google.com/group/kamaelia), [irc](/irc.html), etc

### [Summer of Code](/SummerOfCode.html)

We\'ve been involved with GSOC now for 3 years, and it\'s been great.
One of the less obvious things about GSOC is that it\'s generated a
wealth of docs and ideas which can be dived into here.

### [Source & SVN](/Repository.html)

Kamaelia\'s source is hosted on
[code.google](http://code.google.com/p/kamaelia/), and the latest
release is the [0.9.8.0
release](http://www.kamaelia.org/release/MonthlyReleases/Kamaelia-0.9.8.0.tar.gz).
(Y.Y.M.r). Some apps are also available in the release directory.

### [Wiki](/Wiki.html)

This entire site is powered by, essentially, a wiki engine, if you\'re
interested in contributing please get in [contact](/Contact) and drop us
a line. (It doesn\'t default to open to avoid wikispam, etc) **ie: Think
this site could do with improving? Please help! :)**
