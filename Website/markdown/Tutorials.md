This page has not been fleshed out yet - but there are a significant
number of kamaelia tutrorials now. Given the website is being
renovated/improved, that\'s why this page exists :-)\

For the moment, please take a look at:

The [MiniAxon](/MiniAxon.html) tutorial - build your own Kamaelia Core. (ie
\"How can that really work?\")\

An tutorial regarding [how to go from normal code to
componentised](http://www.kamaelia.org/cgi-bin/blog/blog.cgi?rm=viewpost&nodeid=1113495151)
code. (ie \"how do I write a component\")\

A collection of tutorial [presentations on
slideshare](http://www.slideshare.net/kamaelian/slideshows).\
