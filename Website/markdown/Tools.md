[Visual Pipe Builder - Create Systems
Visually]{style="font-size:14pt;font-weight:600"}

[Availability:]{style="font-weight:600"} Tools directory of Kamaelia
distribution

The Visual Pipe Builder (docs to be written) allows you to visually
create new applications [without writing
code]{style="font-style:italic"}. Currently has the following
limitations:

-   You do have to copy and paste the code generated into a file and
    then run independently
-   The pipe builder only handles pipelines, it doesn\'t handle
    graphlines.

Someone interested in tools could really go to town with this as a
project.

Interactively]{style="font-size:14pt;font-weight:600"}

[Availability:]{style="font-weight:600"} Tools directory of Kamaelia

testing and creating a system of Kamaelia components.

[Axon Visualiser - Look Inside
Systems]{style="font-size:14pt;font-weight:600"}

[Availability:]{style="font-weight:600"} Tools directory of Kamaelia
distribution

The [Axon Visualiser](AxonVisualiser.html) allows you to look inside a
running application to see what\'s going on inside. This is especially
useful for [comparing what you thinkis
]{style="font-style:italic;font-weight:600"}happening [with what
actually is]{style="font-style:italic;font-weight:600"} happening.
