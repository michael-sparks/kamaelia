[Tools for Timeshifting]{style="font-size:24pt;font-weight:600"}

[Make use of your TV]{style="font-size:18pt"}

This is the directly related to the current focus of some of our work.

[Note: ]{style="font-weight:600"}Timeshifting is defined (in the UK),
along the lines of as being you recording something at your home off the
TV for you to watch (probably once) at a more convenient time. One of
the spin offs from some existing internal work will be that it provides
a number of tools that make timeshifting easier. Please note, this page
won\'t contain any legal advice, and these tools are
[only]{style="font-style:italic"} provided for legal timeshifting! If
you\'ve any doubt what these terms mean, or think you might get it
wrong, please consult a lawyer ! If you\'re located in a country where
timeshifting isn\'t protected by law, don\'t use these tools.

[The simplest PVR possible]{style="font-weight:600"}

in time:

The resulting file might then need some conversion for playback by your
favourite media player (obviously you\'ll delete the programme after
watching it).
