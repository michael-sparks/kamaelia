## Kamaelia Documentation

Documentation is a core asset in Kamaelia. As of Jan 2024, this is now
being significantly updated.

While this is done you are invited to look at the [Component Reference](/Components.html) for an indication of the scope of
components, and the [Cookbook](/Cookbook.html) for small examples.

## Quick Overview

The [About](/About.html) page is an overview of the project from a
relatively high level. 

## Books

Two major pieces of Kamaelia documentation are booksized PDFs:

* [The Kamaelia Europython tutorial](/downloads/20090619.KamaeliaPragmaticConcurrencyEuropython09.Final.pdf).
  This is an 84 page book teaching you the ideas behind Kamaelia,
  building your own core, building components and systems.
  **This is probably the best place to start right now.**

  * [Pragmatic Concurrency](/PragmaticConcurrency.html) is an overview of
    this tutorial that also includes the slides to browse through.

* [A newer \>400 page API reference book](/downloads/AxonKamaelia_docs.pdf),
  whose documentation autogenerated & extracted from the codebase -
  covering both Axon and Kamaelia.  (This is new as of Jan 2024 and a bit
  rough around the edges!)


## [Tutorials](/Tutorials.html)

-   Dive into [Kamaelia tutorials from a variety of perspectives](/Tutorials.html)
-   See the [presentations given publicly](/Presentations.html)


## [Cookbook](/Cookbook.html)

This section contains a number of recipes showing how to build a variety
of different types of Kamaelia systems. Sections include:

-   Linking components together
-   Building Network systems, clients, servers, IM, etc
-   Building Digital TV systems
-   Building Multimedia systems
-   Using Kamaelia components & subsystems in non-kamaelia systems.

**More recipes always welcome.**


## API References

* [Full component Reference](/Components.html)
* [Full reference for Axon - the core of Kamaelia](/Docs/Axon/Axon.html)


## Kamaelia based systems

There\'s quite a few Kamaelia systems as example applications in [the
repository on
github](https://github.com/sparkslabs/kamaelia/tree/master/Code/Python/Apps).
Some sample apps:

### [Kamaelia Grey](/KamaeliaGrey.html)

Spam reduction through greylisting. Kamaelia Grey is a SMTP proxy for
your inbound email, rejecting email likely to be spam. Mail likely to
not be spam is forwarded to your normal mail server.

### [Batch Transcoder](/ActiveFileProcessor.html)

This watches directories for new images and videos to transcode to
formats suitable for the web. You can think of it as the backend needed
for a youtube/flickr type site. PDF support is likely to be added soon.

### [Whiteboard](/Developers/Projects/Whiteboard.html)

A collaborative whiteboard. 2 or more machines share a display you can
write on - either can be a server. Whiteboards are paginated, and
therefore can also be used for remote presentations. Really cool with a
tablet.

### [Macro](/KamaeliaMacro.html)

Records and transcodes digital TV for later viewing (ie timeshifting).
It can do this for as many channels at once as you have CPU power and
tuners available for it.
