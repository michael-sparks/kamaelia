Hack for Mashed: Speak And Learn
================================

::: {.boxright}
**NOTE:** This doesn\'t replace actually teaching - but it makes a
lovely toy, in the style of a speak and spell from years ago\...
:::

This hack is a \"toy\" for a small child to assist them to learn to read
and write. They are asked to write specific words - both textually and
also using speech synthesis. What they write is then read out to them.
This version is by no means \"complete\", but it works.\

The vocabulary it teaches (currently) is from sheet one of the DFES
[Reception Term, Reception Year word
cards](http://www.standards.dfes.gov.uk/primary/publications/literacy/nls_framework/485701/)
for literacy in reading/writing.\
