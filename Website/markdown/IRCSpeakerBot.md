Hack for Mashed: IRC Speaker Bot
================================

This is a hack for mashed that does the following things:\

-   It\'s IRC bot
-   It joins 3 channels - \#kamtest, \#kamaelia & \#mashed
-   It listens to the channel

\
Anything that anyone says is then spoken by the bot.\
\
You can find the code here:\

-   <https://kamaelia.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/kamaelia/trunk/Sketches/MPS/IRCSpeakerBot.py>
