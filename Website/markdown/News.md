### News

-   **May 2008** - Project revamp - the project has continued under
    active development since the last news updates. Specifically a new
    iteration of the website is planned for release which should pull in
    more dynamic information more obviously. This is to coincide with a
    new release in June 2008, based on merging work currently sitting in
    Kamaelia branches.\
    \
-   **April 2008** - Project Mailing Lists have moved to Google Groups.
    You can find the **[Kamaelia group
    here](http://groups.google.com/group/kamaelia)**\
    \
-   **November 2006 - Website Revamp**\
    The website is undergoing a revamp at present - mainly to be online
    edittable rather than just offline. This should start to have some
    positive effects :-)\
    \
-   **October 2006 - Kamaelia in December\'s [Linux
    Format](http://www.linuxformat.co.uk/)**\
    Michael has written an article on Kamaelia for this month\'s Linux
    Format - on sale October 19th. It covers how to install and use the
    [Whiteboard](/Whiteboard/) application as well as basics of
    how to write components when building systems. The article will
    appear on this website when the magazine goes off sale!\
    \
-   **October 2006 - Kamaelia Mega Bundle 1.4 released!**\
    The Kamaelia Mega Bundle has been updated for Kamaelia 0.5 and Axon
    1.5.1. It includes the key dependencies that we\'ve tested the code
    with, specifically for components that make use of these external
    libraries. (Kamaelia is usable without these, but they are nice :-)\
    \
    Libraries included: Axon, Kamaelia, BitTorrent, dirac, Dirac (python
    bindings), Imaging, libao, libogg, libvorbis, pyao, pycrypto,
    pygame, pymedia, PyOpenGL, Pyrex, pySpeex, python-dvb3, speex,
    vorbissimple\
    \
-   **October 2006 - Kamaelia 0.5.0 Released!**\
    \
    Kamaelia 0.5.0 marks a major stepping point for the Kamaelia
    project. It means we officially have half the capabilities we see
    ourselves expecting to have when we hit version 1.0, and also marks
    the first release where the number of external contributors to the
    release outweighs developers from inside the BBC, meaning this
    release really does belong to the Google summer of code of code
    students who worked on it.\
    \
    Key highlights of this release:\
    Bit Torrent support; Open GL support; Nascent seaside style
    webserver (sessions controllable by resumable
    components/coroutines), massively enhanced DVB support,
    collaborative whiteboarding with audio (via speex) supporting
    daisychaining of whiteboards (since whiteboards are servers &
    clients), and enhanced visual system composition (ability to compose
    arbitrary graphs now). All of these include examples, including an
    Open GL interface to bit torrent, a bit torrent based simple
    (non-robust yet) streaming system, and a \"record for me\" PVR that
    you give the channel, and programme names to and it figures out the
    rest.\
    \
-   **October 2006 - Axon 1.5.1 Released!**\
    Highlights include:\
    Useful changes for a number of threaded components in the Kamaelia
    0.5.0 release. Synchronous boxes (size limited) are now supported by
    threaded components. Furthermore, synchronous boxes can now also
    pause themselves should the need arise.\

<div>

A lot of work went into visualisation of Kamaelia systems, which is
feeding into the 0.2.0 release. Two documents were produced for this:

-   BBC R&D White Paper 113 - [Kamaelia: highly concurrent and network
    systems tamed](http://www.bbc.co.uk/rd/pubs/whp/whp113.shtml)
-   Grand Challenges: The Changing Landscape of Online Delivery - this
    will appear online shortly in HTML form, but for now the PDF of this
    is included in \"[The handouts from the 2005 Open
    Days](http://www.bbc.co.uk/rd/pubs/whp/whp115.shtml)\" (BBC R&D
    White Paper 115)\
    This document is important for Kamaelia since it describes the
    [motivations ]{style="font-style: italic;"}behind the Kamaelia
    project.
