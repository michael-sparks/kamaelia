[Kamaelia & Google\'s Summer of
Code]{style="font-size:21pt;font-weight:600"}

[This information is
historic.]{style="font-style:italic;font-weight:600"}

[See our [main Summer of Code page](/SummerOfCode.html) to find out how
it all went.]{style="font-style:italic;font-weight:600"}

------------------------------------------------------------------------

If you\'re a student enrolled in a higher education course that matches
[Google\'s definition of who\'s
eligible](http://code.google.com/soc/studentfaq.html), and you\'ve been
thinking \"I keep meaning to try Kamaelia, but don\'t have a project\",
this is an opportunity. You\'ll be paid by Google for your time, your
work will live on as components which are always useful and if you
achieve the project goals, you\'ll produce something cool and useful,
and our undying gratitude :-)

[Note: ]{style="font-weight:600"}You\'re not likely to be working onsite
with us ! (You might be 1/2 way round the world :) )

[Who are we looking for?]{style="font-size:12pt;font-weight:600"}

We\'re looking for enthusiastic people to work on specific projects,
which are listed on our new projects pages (see below). You don\'t
necessarily need lots of experience, indeed we\'ve found a naivete can
actually help since you have less preconceptions about how code should
be written (And often more open to the component approach).

[AGAIN, please note:]{style="font-weight:600"} For summer of code,
we\'re interested in anyone who can code, not just PhD candidates :)
We\'re rating applications based on enthusiasm, approach and project
they want to do as much as we are on people\'s innate ability. Anyone
with sufficient talent OR determination can produce something wonderful.

(The reason for this note is someone made the comment that they thought
we\'re interested only in PhD candidates which is unfortunate. Whilst
Dirac is pretty hardcore, Kamaelia is written in python for a very
specific reason - to lower the barrier to entry)

[Project Ideas\...]{style="font-size:12pt;font-weight:600"}

All the following ideas are linked to on the [main project ideas
page](http://kamaelia.sourceforge.net/cgi-bin/projects/blog.cgi), which
is also a discussion forum if you have any questions or want greater
depth. There is a vague prioritisation but not absolute prioritisation
of this list.

the project, or on the [mailing
list](http://kamaelia.sf.net/Contact.html).

[Want to do your own project idea?
Cool\...]{style="font-size:12pt;font-weight:600"}

\... run it by us, let\'s see if there\'s a fit with the project\'s
needs! The rest of this section will help you with the latter\...

If the projects we\'ve listed don\'t inspire you, or make you go
\"ooooooh\", or \"aahhhh\", please bear in mind this: We\'re a media
organisation, we want to provide the most fun experiences our audience
can have, as widely as we can. That opens up a huge scope for projects,
and we (those of us working on Kamaelia obviously :) at BBC Research
would like to make it such that Kamaelia can provide the toolset to
simplify that process.

Also bear in mind the list is never going to be exhaustive as a result!

Surprise us with something you want to do, that blindsides us and really
helps our goals. If it helps with the [specific challenges we use to
guide our work](http://kamaelia.sourceforge.net/Challenges/) at present,
so much the better. Anything related to DVB-T (freeview), video
transcoding, or aggregation/distribution systems relating to RSS and/or
Atom will also get our attention. (You really need to look here if
you\'re coming up with your own projects :-)

In the past we\'ve had a pre-university trainee work on previewing PVR
content on a mobile phone using Kamaelia as a proof of concept, and a
second year student provide tools and a toolset for a simple reliable
multicast protocol & multicast island joining. What would you like to
do? It could be as simple as helping with packaging of certain
applications we\'d like to see packaged up (eg as executables for
windows & Mac OS X), or as complex as an audio/video conferencing tool.

Please look at the project list first though. Also our current focus of
work is [described
here](http://kamaelia.sourceforge.net/cgi-bin/blog/blog.cgi?rm=viewpost&postid=1137083138),
and anything that relates to that will
[really]{style="font-style:italic"} get our attention.

[One note: ]{style="font-weight:600"}we would prefer ideas to be posted
to [main project ideas
page](http://kamaelia.sourceforge.net/cgi-bin/projects/blog.cgi) where
possible. It won\'t show up immediately, and if you mark it as \"please
don\'t make visible\", we won\'t - and it won\'t be visible

[Some links & Getting
Started\...]{style="font-size:12pt;font-weight:600"}

If you\'ve looked in the past and been looking for help with
installation, we\'ve recently changed over to using a bundled
distribution, which now has accompanying installation notes (We\'ll
expect you to use the latest CVS tree though, generally speaking). As a
result some links that might be of use:

Useful links you\'ll want:

-   [Single page
    introduction](http://kamaelia.sourceforge.net/Introduction.html)
-   [Install & Getting
    Started](http://kamaelia.sourceforge.net/GettingStarted.html)
-   Best way to get started - [understand the core system by writing
    your own](http://kamaelia.sourceforge.net/MiniAxon/). (PLEASE do
    this tutorial if you\'re interested in our projects!)
-   [How to write your own
    components](http://kamaelia.sourceforge.net/cgi-bin/blog/blog.cgi?rm=viewpost&postid=1113495151)

    systems](http://kamaelia.sourceforge.net/Cookbook.html) - how to
    build systems
-   [Component
    Reference](http://kamaelia.sourceforge.net/Components.html)

Some docs on how we work:

    code.](http://kamaelia.sourceforge.net/KamaeliaProjectDevelopment.html)
-   [How we do day to day, and longer
    management](http://kamaelia.sourceforge.net/KamaeliaProjectProcesses.html)

[We have a Template You Should
Use]{style="font-size:12pt;font-weight:600"}

It\'s here: [Summer of Code 2006
Template](SummerOfCode2006Template.html)

[Finally\...]{style="font-size:12pt;font-weight:600"}

There\'s deadlines for student applications, and proposals coming up
real soon. If you\'re interested, please don\'t leave it too late!
Questions on specific projects, we\'d rather answer on the projects page
up top, you can also catch us on \#kamaelia on freenode\'s IRC, and for
general questions contact the list.
