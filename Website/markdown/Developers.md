Kamaelia Development Console
============================

This page serves as a console for the development of the Kamaelia
project itself, starting point, todo list, [ideas](Tasks.html),
etc.**Development Guidelines**\

[**Principles**](/Developers/Principles.html) that guide Kamaelia\'s
development

[**Project Development Process**](/KamaeliaProjectDevelopment.html) -
How we manage code from idea, through development, through to
refinement, and system refactoring

[**Project Management Processes**](/KamaeliaProjectProcesses.html) - How
we manage basic things like day to day to weekly & bimonthly meetings,
such that they\'re *useful* to those involved. ie ***Why*** we use IRC
as much as we do.

[**How to Contribute**](/Developers/Contributing.html)

Coding & Documentaion Guidelines:

-   [Documentation Guidelines](/DocumentationGuidelines.html)
-   [Coding Conventions: Naming of Things](/Developers/CodingConventionsNaming.html)

**Things To Do**

[**Projects**](/Developers/Projects.html) - Projects at various stages of
development - from idea, through development, through dead ends through
to systems that work and can be enhanced.

[**Help Wanted**](/Developers/HelpWanted.html) - Specific tasks waiting for
someone to tackle. This could be as simple as a code review or merge.

-   [**Small Tasks Page**](/Developers/Tasks.html) - These are currently
    unclaimed, but desireable - this is a subset of Help Wanted really,
    you can add wishlist ideas for Kamaelia as a whole here.\

Keep [**Current News**](/CurrentNews.html) and [**Project Status**](/CurrentStatus.html) up to date!

[**Speculative new ideas**](/Developers/SpeculativeNewIdeas.html) are always
interesting, and would probably start out as sketches for things which
could be useful. Componentising certain sorts of things can be a very
useful endevour since they can then be reused with all the other
components.\
