[Licensing]{style="font-size:25pt"}

Kamaelia is released under the Mozilla trilicense scheme (MPL/GPL/LGPL).
Specifically you may choose to accept either the Mozilla Public License
1.1, the GNU General Public License 2.0 or the Lesser General Public
License 2.1.

If commercial parties wish to discuss alternative licensing please
contact us.

-   Please note though: since you can choose to accept the LGPL this
    means that you can use Kamaelia code in any project of your choice
    without releasing your code, as long as you don\'t change any
    Kamaelia or Axon code. Due to the nature of Python and Python
    libraries we don\'t count simple inheritance (that is [class
    foo(component): \...]{style="font-family:Courier"} ) as modification
    to Kamaelia or Axon.

Essentially this boils down to this:

-   If you change any of the code that is part of the Kamaelia project
    as part of your project and release your project, then the recipient
    of that project should recieve a copy of Kamaelia and the changed
    code.
