Forgotten Password
==================

This is still to do, but it will work as follows:\

-   User should enter their email
-   They\'ll hit submit
-   They will then be sent an email with a new, generated password,
    which they will need to use.
-   The reason is because passwords are not actually stored in plain
    text on the server, and like many good practices actually one way
    encrypted.\

I suppose that this also means that we also need a \"change password\"
option.

-   This would work in a similar way to registration
