Brought [Current Status](/CurrentStatus) overview up-to-date

Created & rolled out new home page (currently [here](/NewHome))\

Changed/simplified website template

Publicise (via the website dev console) the process for contributing to

Rolled out start of website revamp. Wiki engine and CDML renderer from

Probably need to make the fact that things reusuable should be extracted
clearer. (thinking of the backplane)

Created first draft of a project mission, goals, direction page.

Discussed idea of laying out the Projects space for Project Task Pages,
decided on page tagging instead.\

Pulled in the Challenges into the Projects page as classifications of
already done work in these areas. Started documenting the work so far of

progress.\
