Website Suggestions
===================

No site is perfect, this site is no different there. Please feel free to
add your thoughts here as to what needs improving.\

My main concern is with the home and introductory pages, because I think
they are very important, among other things, because for newcomers they
represent people behind the project and its activity and health. Is like
to give a good first impression. Why to focus on newcomers? In my
opinion, one of the main OS project goals is to attract visitors and
collaborators, show the best of the project and act like calling clients
in the bazaar. So I will focus mainly on those areas.\
\
- I like the idea of building the menu out of hexagons. In my opinion
the hexagon menu design (looks like a hive menu, but is that a flower?)
on the [Documentation page](../../../Docs/.html) looks more organized, I mean
has cleaner visual composition than the one on the home page.\
- I think that the \"What is Kamaelia?\" hexagon from the Documentation
page is important enough to be present on the home page.\
- I think that the OS projects that are driven by many people, must have
a presentation page that welcomes newcomers. This means that the home
page must have only the necessary links: I would omit the detailed
\"Recent Changes\" section, the Current Status and the Mailing lists
section on the home page so it may fit in one or two monitor screens. I
like very much the [RubyonRails home page](http://rubyonrails.com/), but
I do not mean that Kamaelia\'s web should look like just another rails
clone.\
- I guess any news are better than no news, specially if they are
located on the main page, so the project will look more active to
visitors (actual news are 5 months old).\
- When I visit a new site, in the HOME page, I automatically start
looking for a single menu containing names that look familiar, it is
like a pattern that I follow searching for links like, for example:
\"about\", \"download\", \"contact us\", \"news\", \"documentation\"
\"tutorials\" \"case studies/use cases\" \"partners\" \"site map\"
\"search\" \"blog\" \"wiki\" (well, the site is a wiki :))). While there
are already most of those links (I think the about link is a must), I
guess they must be arrenged in a clean menu, the hive of hexagons looks
nice, but the links are repeated from the text menu on the top right
corner, I find that redundancy confusing.\
I like the way pages like the [How](../../../MiniAxon/) and
[Why](../../../Challenges/) present their content. Maybe we can present
other web sections (i.e. Introduction, Tutorials, News) like a
storytelling, guiding the new visitor from page to page with brief info
and suggesting further reading when appropiate through
links[](../../../Challenges/). Introduction and tutorials may follow the
same model.\
Well that is what I observed. Maybe I am not very specific, but I think
the whole home page has to be rearrenged with newbies in mind. The
people familiar with the project may have less fancy and more technical
pages available deeper in the web tree.\
\
PD: Project Blog is not accesible and SummerOfCode still points to the
SOC 2006 page.\

Suggest we change the \"LEARN what\'s under the hood\" hexagon on the
[home page](../../../) and [docs page](../../../Docs/) to link to [this
page](../../../Docs/Axon.html) instead of directly to the [mini axon
tutorial](../../../MiniAxon/). Why? because some people (eg. me) might
interpret it as meaning go here for tutorials/learning/reference stuff
about how Axon/Kamaelia works. The suggested page still prominently
directs people to the mini axon tutorial, but also provides other
options. To my mind, it also places the tutorial into a context where
they can subsequently move on to find out more (ie. gives someone other
places to go to when they\'ve done the tutorial)\

I\'d like to see a reference to the CDML codes the site uses.

-   *(Basic) reference to CDML added to the website here:
    [/Wiki](/Wiki.html)* *\-- Michael, 7th June.\

A search function would be really nice (but I know it may be a tad hard
to implement).

http://www.kamaelia.org/Developers/Projects/KamaeliaPublish/ and
http://www.kamaelia.org/Developers/Projects/KamaeliaPublish bring up
two different webpages.

-   *This is not a bug, this is by (conscious) design. You can make then
    have the same text by doing an include. This is what
    [/Components](/Components.html) does.* *\-- Michael, 7th June.\
