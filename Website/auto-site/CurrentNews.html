<p>March 2024 - This site, and Kamaelia are <a href="https://github.com/sparkslabs/kamaelia/issues/15">being updated</a>. There is significant work needed, and <a href="https://github.com/sparkslabs/kamaelia/pulls">PRs</a> are welcome.

<h3 id="news">News</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>May 2008</strong> - Project revamp - the project has
continued under active development since the last news updates.
Specifically a new iteration of the website is planned for release which
should pull in more dynamic information more obviously. This is to
coincide with a new release in June 2008, based on merging work
currently sitting in Kamaelia branches.<br />
<br />
</li>
<li><strong>April 2008</strong> - Project Mailing Lists have moved to
Google Groups. You can find the <strong><a
href="http://groups.google.com/group/kamaelia">Kamaelia group
here</a></strong><br />
<br />
</li>
<li><strong>November 2006 - Website Revamp</strong><br />
The website is undergoing a revamp at present - mainly to be online
edittable rather than just offline. This should start to have some
positive effects :-)<br />
<br />
</li>
<li><strong>October 2006 - Kamaelia in December's <a
href="http://www.linuxformat.co.uk/">Linux Format</a></strong><br />
Michael has written an article on Kamaelia for this month's Linux Format
- on sale October 19th. It covers how to install and use the <a
href="/Whiteboard/">Whiteboard</a> application as well as basics of how
to write components when building systems. The article will appear on
this website when the magazine goes off sale!<br />
<br />
</li>
<li><strong>October 2006 - Kamaelia Mega Bundle 1.4
released!</strong><br />
The Kamaelia Mega Bundle has been updated for Kamaelia 0.5 and Axon
1.5.1. It includes the key dependencies that we've tested the code with,
specifically for components that make use of these external libraries.
(Kamaelia is usable without these, but they are nice :-)[A<br />
<br />
Libraries included: Axon, Kamaelia, BitTorrent, dirac, Dirac (python
bindings), Imaging, libao, libogg, libvorbis, pyao, pycrypto, pygame,
pymedia, PyOpenGL, Pyrex, pySpeex, python-dvb3, speex,
vorbissimple<br />
<br />
</li>
<li><strong>October 2006 - Kamaelia 0.5.0 Released!</strong><br />
<br />
Kamaelia 0.5.0 marks a major stepping point for the Kamaelia project. It
means we officially have half the capabilities we see ourselves
expecting to have when we hit version 1.0, and also marks the first
release where the number of external contributors to the release
outweighs developers from inside the BBC, meaning this release really
does belong to the Google summer of code of code students who worked on
it.<br />
<br />
Key highlights of this release:<br />
Bit Torrent support; Open GL support; Nascent seaside style webserver
(sessions controllable by resumable components/coroutines), massively
enhanced DVB support, collaborative whiteboarding with audio (via speex)
supporting daisychaining of whiteboards (since whiteboards are servers
&amp; clients), and enhanced visual system composition (ability to
compose arbitrary graphs now). All of these include examples, including
an Open GL interface to bit torrent, a bit torrent based simple
(non-robust yet) streaming system, and a "record for me" PVR that you
give the channel, and programme names to and it figures out the
rest.<br />
<br />
</li>
<li><strong>October 2006 - Axon 1.5.1 Released!</strong><br />
Highlights include:<br />
Useful changes for a number of threaded components in the Kamaelia 0.5.0
release. Synchronous boxes (size limited) are now supported by threaded
components. Furthermore, synchronous boxes can now also pause themselves
should the need arise.<br />
