<p>Feb 2024 - This site, and Kamaelia are <a href="https://github.com/sparkslabs/kamaelia/issues/15">being updated</a>. There is significant work needed, and <a href="https://github.com/sparkslabs/kamaelia/pulls">PRs</a> are welcome.

<h1 id="hack-for-mashed-speak-and-learn">Hack for Mashed: Speak And Learn</h1>
<div class="boxright">
<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> This doesn't replace actually teaching - but it makes a lovely toy, in the style of a speak and spell from years ago...</p>
</div>
<p>This hack is a "toy" for a small child to assist them to learn to read and write. They are asked to write specific words - both textually and also using speech synthesis. What they write is then read out to them. This version is by no means "complete", but it works.<br />
</p>
<p>The vocabulary it teaches (currently) is from sheet one of the DFES <a href="http://www.standards.dfes.gov.uk/primary/publications/literacy/nls_framework/485701/">Reception Term, Reception Year word cards</a> for literacy in reading/writing.<br />
