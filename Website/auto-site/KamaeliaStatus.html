<p>March 2024 - This site, and Kamaelia are <a href="https://github.com/sparkslabs/kamaelia/issues/15">being updated</a>. There is significant work needed, and <a href="https://github.com/sparkslabs/kamaelia/pulls">PRs</a> are welcome.
</div>
<p><span style="font-size: 20pt; font-weight: 600;">Status</span></p>
<p>The bulk of Kamaelia is a collection of components that use Axon.
These range from components for building network servers and clients
using TCP and Multicast, through to music playback, audio codec decode
through to components suitable for viewing network topologies and
interactive systems - such as networked personal autocues.</p>
<p><a href="http://kamaelia.sourceforge.net/Docs/Axon.html"><span
style="font-weight: 600;">Axon</span></a><span
style="font-weight: 600;">-</span>Kamaelia core concurrency
framework</p>
<p>Axon is available from Kamaelia's main <a
href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/kamaelia/">sourceforge project
page</a>.</p>
<p>The current status of the project is that Axon itself has been deemed
feature stable, and currently stands at version 1.5.1. Axon runs on
Windows, Mac OS X, Linux and Series 60 mobile phones. This is
sufficiently stable in terms of API and coverage in terms of testcases
to be used as is. It should work with python 2.2 onwards. <a
href="Contact.html">If it doesn't, please let us know!</a></p>
<p><span style="font-style: italic;">Documentation, Stability,
Completeness</span></p>
<p>We believe Axon to be largely feature complete given that it's
functionality has been driven by application spikes whilst writing
Kamaelia. Documentation for Axon is in the process of collation into
this website, with the <a href="Docs/Axon.html">main starting page
here</a>.</p>
<p>Examples included with Axon's release:</p>
<ul>
<li>A simple producer/consumer example - this shows how to build
components, and build pipelines manually. (Syntactic sugar for pipelines
exists inside Kamaelia's Util tree)</li>
<li>A more complex, but still simple producer/consumer example.</li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 600;">Kamaelia</span></p>
<p>The Kamaelia portion is the larger of the two parts to the project
since it is a collection of components that use Axon. These range from
components for building network servers and clients through to music
playback, audio codec decode through to components suitable for viewing
network topologies and interactive systems.</p>
<p>We feel we're about half way towards reaching a 1.0 release. As a
result the current version number reflects this and currently stands at
0.5.0. That said, like Axon, it runs on Windows, Mac OS X, Linux and
Series 60 mobile phones. Though it is considered an alpha release, don't
be put off. It is already very functional and generally very
stable.<br />
</p>
<p>Examples included with Kamaelia's 0.1.2 release:</p>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-weight: 600;">Example 1:</span>A simple
"FortuneCookie" protocol system. Includes server and client as part of a
single system.</li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 600;">Example 2:</span>This has much the
same structure, but rather than serve and display fortune cookies,
serves (ogg vorbis) audio over a TCP connection to a client which
decodes and plays back the audio.</li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 600;">Example 3:</span>Splits the
structure in example 2 into a specific server application and a client
application. On a single CPU system with Axon versions 1.1.0 or lower,
this causes problems because Axon doesn't hint to the system it's busy
waiting and interruptable. Above that Axon does. (Hence why the latest
version of Axon is generally recommended)</li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 600;">Example 4:</span> Simple multicast
based ogg vorbis streaming system.</li>
</ul>
<p>Examples to be included in Kamaelia's 0.2 release (see <a
href="Download.html">Downloads</a>):</p>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-weight: 600;">Example 5:</span> An introspecting
version of Examples 2/3. This creates a simple streaming system, and
looks inside to see what components are running/active, and passes the
resulting information over a network connection to an Axon Visualisation
server.</li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 600;">Example 6:</span> This is a
simple/generic topology visualisation server. The server listens on port
1500, and accepts the following commands:<br />
ADD NODE id label auto -<br />
ADD LINK id id<br />
DEL NODE id<br />
DEL ALL</li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 600;">Example 7:</span> This shows how the
visualisation subsystem can be extended to work in different ways. What
this does by default when run is randomly create new nodes and new
linkages quite quickly, allowing you to see how the system works.</li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 600;">Example 8:</span> Sample
slideshow/presentation tool. Unlike traditional slideshow/presentation
tools, you can modify this to run arbitrary components. An example of
how this can work is provided - allowing stepping through some graph
visualisations along with the presentation.</li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 600;">Example 9</span>: Simple component
based game using pygame. Not quite fully integrated with the other
pygame code (will be), but fully reusable &amp; reconfigurable code and
it's a useful start for people wanting to see how to write things
varying from games through other interactive systems.</li>
</ul>
