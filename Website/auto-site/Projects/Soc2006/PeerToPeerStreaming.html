<h3 id="peer-to-peer-streaming-architecture-using-kamaelia">Peer-to-Peer streaming architecture using Kamaelia</h3>
<p>*Project motivation*<br />
In recent years the concept of peer-to-peer streaming has received increased attention from the academic and<br />
research communities, partly because the Internet doesn't widely support multicast, and because of the need for<br />
a large scale content distribution system.<br />
<br />
The project I would like to work on is an experiment with such an architecture. The core idea is that each peer<br />
that takes part in such an architecture can receive data segments from several other peers, aggregate and play them,<br />
and also server data segments (at various rates), to other peers. The Kamaelia-based approach is to have a component<br />
that receives media streaming segments from a number of similar components, and can also serve a number of other components with the media it receives. It should be able to take advantage of local multicast facilities.<br />
<br />
From the perspective of the challenges that BBC Research is facing, this project would be an attempt to integrate<br />
P2P and Multicast, because it provide a way to deliver media streaming information between smaller multicast islands,<br />
where effective communication will be achieved by more efficient, lower-level, mechanisms.<br />
<br />
Here is a selected list of papers regarding these topics:<br />

<br />
*Architecture*<br />
<br />
The core component to the architecture is a component that can receive data segments from N other components, aggregate them, and send them to a "player" component. Also, based on the underlying allocation algorithm, it can serve data segments to other peers itself. For the beginning the streaming data will be a simple integer stream, and the "player" a checker for consistency (mainly, whether the segments are in the right order, and whether there are missing segments).<br />
<br />
A subset of peers will have only one input, from a component named a "seeder", which will generate the data. The discovery and the process of building the architecture still present some challenges, and I will probably start with a statically specified architecture; using a "building" utility, that reads this topology's description from a file and builds its logical structure in Python by interconnecting the "peer" components. Also, I will try to explore different algorithms and strategies for initial building of the topology, and its maintenance.<br />
<br />
A special case is that of the multicast islands. Because they support more efficient ways of communication, it is reasonable that they are treated as a single peer by the external network. This possibility suggests the following architecture choice: each peer can be linked to its own Multicast_transceiver, that communicates to the multicast island this peer takes part in. This separation allows us to receive data "into" the multicast island through more than one peers, a more realistic approach to a high demand network.<br />
<br />
To sum up we have:<br />
* seeders, that generate the data<br />
* peers, that have a sense of the topology surrounding them; they receive streaming data from several other peers and feed it into the player; moreover, it can be connected to a Multicast_transceiver in case it takes part in a multicast island, and can relay streaming data to a number of other peers<br />
* player, which will aggregate the data segments in the correct order, perform buffering, if required, and "play" the data, depending on its type<br />
<br />
Problems that need to be addressed:<br />
* initial topology setup<br />
* topology maintenance<br />
* multicast islands identification<br />
* from a peer's point of view, the network discovery<br />
<br />
Finally, I would like to try some experiments using "real" audio or video streaming, as opposed to simplified mock-up data.<br />
<br />
*Timeline*<br />
<br />
* 20 June - detailed specifications for the architecture and the peer component<br />
* 30 June - implementation of the peer, seeder and player components, for a simplified data stream<br />
* 20 July - multicast and support for audio or video data<br />
* 1 August - automatic topology discovering, using one or more directories<br />
* 20 August - documentation, testing, experimenting<br />
<br />
*Deliverables*<br />
<br />
* the implementation of the "peer", "seeder" and "player" components, with documentation<br />
* the utilities used to set up a topology<br />
* a detailed report describing the approach and algorithms used<br />
* a tutorial for using the components<br />
