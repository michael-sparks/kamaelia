<p>March 2024 - This site, and Kamaelia are <a href="https://github.com/sparkslabs/kamaelia/issues/15">being updated</a>. There is significant work needed, and <a href="https://github.com/sparkslabs/kamaelia/pulls">PRs</a> are welcome.

<p>Version: Axon 1.0</p>
<p><span style="font-weight:600">TODO:</span>Needs better test suite</p>
<p>You provide the scheduler with microthreads of microprocesses, and it
runs them, clean and simple. This is usually handled by the component
system via returning a newComponent value. An alternative is to call the
component's activate method.</p>
<p>It also has a slow motion mode designed to help with debugging &amp;
testing.</p>
<p><span style="font-size:14pt;font-weight:600">Pydoc Style

<p>class scheduler(Axon.Microprocess.microprocess)</p>
<p>Method resolution order:</p>
<ul>
<li>scheduler</li>
<li>Axon.Microprocess.microprocess</li>
<li>Axon.Axon.AxonObject</li>
<li>__builtin__.object</li>
</ul>
<p>Data and other attributes defined here:</p>
<ul>
<li>run = &lt;Axon.Scheduler.scheduler object&gt; - this is the default
scheduler</li>
</ul>
<p>Methods defined here:</p>
<p><span style="font-weight:600">__init__(self)</span></p>
<p>Creates a scheduler object. If scheduler.run has not been set, sets
it. Class initialisation ensures that this object/class attribute is
initialised - client modules always have access to a standalone
scheduler.<br />
Internal attributes:</p>
<ul>
<li>time = time when this object was last active.</li>
<li>threads = list of threads to run.</li>
</ul>
<div>
<p>Whilst there can be more than one scheduler active in the general
case you will NOT want to create a custom scheduler.</p>
</div>
<p><span style="font-weight:600">main(self, slowmo=0)</span></p>
<p>This is the meat of the scheduler - this actively loops round the
threads that it has available to run, and runs them. The only control
over the scheduler at present is a means to slow it down - ie run in
slow motion.</p>
<div>
<p>The way this is run is as follows:</p>
</div>
<div>

</div>
<div>
<p>where delay is in seconds. If the delay is 0, the the system runs all
the threads as fast as it can. If the delay is non zero - eg 0.5, then
the system runs all the threads for one "cycle", waits until the delay
has passed, and then times again. Note : the delay is between the start
points of cycles, and not between the start and end points of cycles.
The delay is NOT 100% accurate nor guaranteed and can be extended by
threads that take too long to complete. (Think of it as a "hello world"
of soft-real time scheduling)</p>

<p><span style="font-weight:600">runThreads(self, slowmo=0)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14pt;font-weight:600">Testdoc

<p>Needs major work. (See todo above!)</p>
