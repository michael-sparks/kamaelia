<p>March 2024 - This site, and Kamaelia are <a href="https://github.com/sparkslabs/kamaelia/issues/15">being updated</a>. There is significant work needed, and <a href="https://github.com/sparkslabs/kamaelia/pulls">PRs</a> are welcome.

capabilities</h3>
<p><a href="/Components/pydoc/Kamaelia.Audio">Kamaelia.Audio</a>
contains components implementing audio input and output as well as
support for some codecs such as MP3. These are provided by using the
cross-platform pymedia library (make sure you have installed it!). Some
bespoke components for audio filtering and mixing are also held
here.<br />
</p>
<p><a href="/Components/pydoc/Kamaelia.Codec">Kamaelia.Codec</a>
contains components for encoding and decoding Dirac video, and Speex and
Ogg Vorbis audio, as well as support for parsing raw data into video
frame data structures. There is also a libAO based audio player, which
obviously requires libAO and the pyao python bindings.</p>
<p><strong>Formats used to pass audio and video between
components</strong><br />
</p>
<p>Audio components for the most part pass around raw audio data as raw
pcm data in python strings.</p>
<p>Uncompressed raw video is passed around as whole frames - using a
dictionary structure containing the raw data and useful metadata such as
the width, height, pixel format and frame rate.</p>
