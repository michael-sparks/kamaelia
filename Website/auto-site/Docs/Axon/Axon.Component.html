<p>A component is a microprocess with a microthread of control and
input/output queues (inboxes and outboxes) which can be connected by
linkages to other components. Ie. it has code that runs whilst the
component is active, and mechanisms for sending and receiving data to
and from other components.</p>
<ul>
<li>A component is based on a microprocess - giving it its thread of
execution.</li>
</ul>
<p>There are other variants on the basic component:</p>
<ul>
<li><a
href="/Docs/Axon/Axon.AdaptiveCommsComponent.AdaptiveCommsComponent.html"
class="reference">Axon.AdaptiveCommsComponent.AdaptiveCommsComponent</a></li>
<li><a href="/Docs/Axon/Axon.ThreadedComponent.threadedcomponent.html"

<li><a
href="/Docs/Axon/Axon.ThreadedComponent.threadedadaptivecommscomponent.html"
class="reference">Axon.ThreadedComponent.threadedadaptivecommscomponent</a></li>
</ul>
<p>If your component needs to block - eg. wait on a system call; then
make it a 'threaded' component. If it needs to change what inboxes or
outboxes it has at runtime, then make it an 'adaptive' component.</p>
<h2 id="18"><span id="the-basics-of-writing-a-component">The basics of
writing a component</span></h2>
<p>Here's a simple example:</p>
<pre class="literal-block"><code>class MyComponent(Axon.Component.component):

    Inboxes = { &quot;inbox&quot;   : &quot;Send the FOO objects to here&quot;,
                &quot;control&quot; : &quot;NOT USED&quot;,
              }
    Outboxes = { &quot;outbox&quot; : &quot;Emits BAA objects from here&quot;,
                 &quot;signal&quot; : &quot;NOT USED&quot;,
               }

    def main(self):
        while 1:
            if self.dataReady(&quot;inbox&quot;):
                msg = self.recv(&quot;inbox&quot;)
                result = ... do something to msg ...
                self.send(result, &quot;outbox&quot;)

            yield 1</code></pre>
<p>Or, more specifically:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p><strong>Subclass the component class</strong>. Don't forget to
call the superclass initializer if you write your own __init__
method:</p>
<pre class="literal-block"><code>class MyComponent(Axon.Component.component):

    def __init__(self, myArgument, ...):
        super(MyComponent, self).__init__()
        ...</code></pre></li>
<li><p><strong>Declare any inboxes or outboxes you expect it to
have</strong> - do this as static members of the class called "Inbox"
and "Outbox". They should be dictionaries where the key is the box name
and the value serves as documentation describing what the box is
for:</p>
<pre class="literal-block"><code>Inboxes = { &quot;inbox&quot;   : &quot;Send the FOO objects to here&quot;,
            &quot;control&quot; : &quot;NOT USED&quot;,
          }
Outboxes = { &quot;outbox&quot; : &quot;Emits BAA objects from here&quot;,
             &quot;signal&quot; : &quot;NOT USED&quot;,
           }</code></pre>
<p>You can also do this as lists, but doing it as a dictionary with
documentation values is much more useful to people wanting to use your
component.</p>
<p>If you don't specify any then you get the default "inbox" and
"control" inboxes and "outbox" and "signal" outboxes.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Write the main() method</strong> - it must be a generator
- namely just like an ordinary method or function, but with 'yield'
statements regularly interspersed through it. This is the thread of
execution in the component - just use yield statements regularly so
other components get time to execute.</p>

<h2 id="19"><span id="running-a-component">Running a
component</span></h2>
<p>Once you have written your component class; simply create instances
and activate them; then start the scheduler to begin execution:</p>
<pre class="literal-block"><code>x = MyComponent()
y = MyComponent()
z = AnotherComponent()
x.activate()
y.activate()
z.activate()

scheduler.run.runThreads()</code></pre>
<p>If the scheduler is already running, then simply activating a
component will start it executing.</p>
<h2 id="20"><span
id="communicating-with-other-components-creating-linkages">Communicating
with other components - creating linkages</span></h2>
<p>Components have inboxes and outboxes. The main() thread of execution
in a component communicates with others by picking up messages that
arrive in its inboxes and sending out messages to its outboxes. For
example here is a simple block of code for the main() method of a
component that echoes anything it receives to the console and also sends
it on:</p>
<pre class="literal-block"><code>if self.dataReady(&quot;inbox&quot;):
    msg = self.recv(&quot;inbox&quot;)
    print str(msg)
    self.send(msg,&quot;outbox&quot;)

yield 1</code></pre>
<p>Use the dataReady() method to find out if there is (one or more items
of) data waiting at the inbox you name. recv() lets you collect a
message from an inbox. Use the send() method to send a message to the
outbox you name. There is also an anyReady() method that will tell you
if <em>any</em> inbox has data waiting in it.</p>
<p>A message gets from one component's outbox to another one's inbox if
there is a linkage between them (going from the outbox to the inbox). A
component can create and destroy linkages by using the link() and
unlink() methods.</p>
<p>For example, we could create a linkage from a component's outbox
called "outbox" to a different component's inbox called "inbox":</p>
<pre class="literal-block"><code>theLink = self.link( (self, &quot;outbox&quot;), (otherComponent, &quot;inbox&quot;) )</code></pre>
<p>Using the handle that we were given, we can destroy that linkage
later:</p>
<pre class="literal-block"><code>self.unlink(theLinkage = theLink)</code></pre>
<p>Linkages normally go from an outbox to an inbox - after all the whole
idea is to get messages that one component sends to its own outbox to
arrive at another component's inbox. However you can also create
'passthrough' linkages from an inbox to another inbox; or from an outbox
to another outbox.</p>
<p>This is particularly useful if you want to encapsulate a child
component - hide it from view so other components only need to be wired
up to you.</p>
<p>For example, your component may want any data being sent to one of
its inboxes to be forwarded automatically onto an inbox on the child.
This is a type '1' passthrough linkage:</p>
<pre class="literal-block"><code>thelink = self.link( (self,&quot;inbox&quot;), (myChild,&quot;inbox&quot;), passthrough=1 )</code></pre>
<p>Or if you want anything a child sends to its outbox to be sent out of
one of your own outboxes, which is a type '2' passthrough:</p>
<pre class="literal-block"><code>thelink = self.link( (myChild,&quot;outbox&quot;), (self,&quot;outbox&quot;), passthrough=2 )</code></pre>
<p>The alternative, of course, is to add extra inboxes and outboxes to
communicate with the child, and to write a main() method that simply
passes the data on. Passthrough linkages are more efficient and quicker
to code!</p>
<p>There is no performance penalty for delivering a message along a such
a chain of linkages (eg. outbox ---&gt; outbox ---&gt; inbox ---&gt;
inbox ---&gt; inbox). Axon resolves the chain and delivers straight to
the final destination inbox!</p>
<h2 id="21"><span id="child-components">Child components</span></h2>
<p>Components can create and activate other components. They can adopt
them as children:</p>
<pre class="literal-block"><code>newComponent = FooComponent()
self.addChildren(newComponent)
newComponent.activate()</code></pre>
<p>Making a component your child means that:</p>
<ul>
<li>you will be woken (if asleep) when your child terminates</li>
<li>the removeChild() method provides a convenient way to make sure any
linkages you have made involving that child are destroyed.</li>
<li>calling childComponents() lists all children you currently have</li>
</ul>
<p>Whether another component is your child or not, you can tell if it
has terminated yet by calling its _isStopped() method.</p>
<p>For example, a component might want to create a child component, make
a linkage to it then wait until that child terminates before cleaning it
up. Achieve this by writing code like this in the main() body of the
component:</p>
<pre class="literal-block"><code>src = RateControlledFileReader(&quot;myTextFile&quot;,readmode=&quot;lines&quot;)
dst = ConsoleEchoer()

lnk = self.link( (src,&quot;outbox&quot;), (dst,&quot;inbox&quot;) )

self.addChildren(src,dst)    # we will be woken if they terminate
src.activate()
dst.activate()

while not dst._isStopped() and not src._isStopped():
    self.pause()
    yield 1

self.unlink(thelinkage = lnk)
self.removeChild(src)
self.removeChild(dst)</code></pre>
<h2 id="22"><span id="going-to-sleep-pausing">Going to sleep
(pausing)</span></h2>
<p>When a component has nothing to do it can pause. This means it will
not be executed again until it is woken up. Pausing is a good thing
since it relinquishes cpu time for other parts of the system instead of
just wasting it.</p>
<p><strong>When would you want to pause?</strong> - usually when there
is nothing left waiting in any of your inboxes and there is nothing else
for your component to do:</p>
<pre class="literal-block"><code>class Echoer(Axon.Component.component):

    def main(self):
        while 1:
            if self.dataReady(&quot;inbox&quot;):
                msg = self.recv(&quot;inbox&quot;)
                print str(msg)
                self.send(msg,&quot;outbox&quot;)

            if not self.anyReady():
                self.pause()

            yield 1</code></pre>
<p>Calling the pause() method means that <em>at the next yield
statement</em> your component will be put to sleep. It doesn't happen as
soon as you call pause() - only when execution reaches the next <code
class="docutils literal">yield</code>.</p>
<p><strong>What will wake up a paused component?</strong> - any of the
following:</p>
<ul>
<li>a message arriving at any inbox (even one with messages already
waiting in it)</li>
<li>a message being collected from an inbox that is linked to one of our
outboxes</li>
<li>a child component terminating</li>
</ul>
<p>Your component <em>cannot</em> wake itself up - only the actions of
other components can cause it to be woken. Why? You try writing some
code that stops executing (pauses) yet can issue a method call to ask to
be woken! :-)</p>
<h2 id="23"><span id="old-style-main-thread">Old style main
thread</span></h2>
<p>Components also currently support an 'old' style for writing their
main thread of execution.</p>
<p><strong>This way of writing components is likely to be deprecated in
the near future. We suggest you write a main() method as a generator
instead.</strong></p>
<p>To do old-style; instead of writing a generator you write 3 functions
- one for initialisation, main execution and termination. The thread of
execution for the component is therefore effectively this:</p>
<pre class="literal-block"><code>self.initialiseComponent()

while 1:
    result = self.mainBody()
    if not result:
        break

self.closeDownComponent()</code></pre>
<p>initialiseComponent() is called once when the component first starts
to execute.</p>
<p>mainBody() is called every execution cycle whilst it returns a non
zero value. If it returns a zero value then the component starts to shut
down.</p>
<p>closeDownComponent() is called when the component is about to shut
down.</p>
<p>A simple echo component might look like this:</p>
<pre class="literal-block"><code>class EchoComponent(Axon.Component.component):

    def initialiseComponent(self):
        # We can perform pre-loop initialisation here!
        # In this case there is nothing really to do
        return 1

    def mainBody(self):
        # We&#39;re now in the main loop
        if self.dataReady(&quot;inbox&quot;):
            msg = self.recv(&quot;inbox&quot;)
            print msg
            self.send(msg,&quot;outbox&quot;)

        if not self.anyReady():
            self.pause()

        # If we wanted to exit the loop, we return a false value
        # at the end of this function
        # If we want to continue round, we return a true, non-None,
        # value. This component is set to run &amp; run...
        return 1

  def closeDownComponent(self):
        # We can&#39;t get here since mainLoop above always returns true
        # If it returned false however, we would get sent here for
        # shutdown code.
        # After executing this, the component stops execution
        return</code></pre>

Implementation</span></h2>
<p>Component is a subclass of microprocess (from which it inherits the
ability to have a thread of execution). It includes its own postoffice
object for creating and destroying linkages. It has a collection of
inboxes and outboxes.</p>
<p>Attributes:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Inboxes</strong> and <strong>Outboxes</strong> - static
members defining the list of names for inboxes and outboxes a component
should be given when it is created.</li>
<li><strong>inboxes</strong> and <strong>outboxes</strong> - the actual
collections of inboxes and outboxes that are set up when the component
is initialised. Implemented as dictionaries mapping names to the postbox
objects.</li>
<li><strong>postoffice</strong> - a postoffice object, used to create,
destroy and manage linkages.</li>
<li><strong>children</strong> - list of components registered as
children of this component.</li>
<li><strong>_callOnCloseDown</strong> - list of callback functions to be
called when this component terminates. Used to notify parents of
children that their child has terminated.</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="25">Test documentation</h1>
<p>Tests passed:</p>
<ul>
<li>__init__ - Class constructor is expected to be called without
arguments.</li>

component object and the name of it.</li>
<li>__str__ - Returns a string representation of the component-

overridden by clients.</li>
<li>dataReady - Returns true if the supplied inbox has data ready for
processing.</li>
<li>initialiseComponent - Stub method, returns 1, expected to be
overridden by clients.</li>
<li>link - Creates a link, handled by the component's postoffice, that
links a source component to it's sink, honouring passthrough, pipewidth
and synchronous attributes.</li>
<li>The _closeDownMicroprocess method ensures any linkages the component
has made that still exist are removed.</li>
<li>mainBody - stub method, returns None, expected to be overridden by
clients as the main loop.</li>
<li>main - This ensures that the closeDownComponent method is called at
the end of the loop. It also repeats the above test.</li>
<li>main - Returns a generator that implements the documented behaviour
of a highly simplistic approach component statemachine.</li>
<li>recv - Takes the first item available off the specified inbox, and
returns it.</li>
<li>removeChild - Removes the specified component from the set of child
components and deregisters it from the postoffice.</li>
<li>send - Takes the message and places it into the specified
outbox.</li>
<li>In a chain of linkages, all owners of outboxes are notified when a
message is picked up.</li>
<li>In a chain of linkages with more than one inbox, only the final
destination is woken when a message is sent.</li>
<li>In a chain of linkages, only the owners of outboxes are notified
when a message is picked up.</li>
<li>A paused component is unpaused when a message is delivered to its
inbox.</li>
<li>If the linkage chain breaks before a message is collected, the
owners of outboxes that are no longer in the chain are not
notified.</li>
<li>If a message is sent, then a new linkage added before a message is
collected, the owner of the newly linked in outbox will notified
too.</li>
<li>If the linkage chain breaks and is then re-established before a
message is collected, the owners of outboxes that are no longer in the
chain are not notified, but ones that are will be.</li>
<li>A paused component stays paused if nothing happens</li>
<li>A paused component is not unpaused when it sends a message.</li>
<li>A paused component is unpaused when a consumer picks up a message it
has sent.</li>

id="symbol-component.__addChild">__addChild(self, child)</span></h4>
<p>Register component as a child.</p>
<p>This takes a child component, and adds it to the children list of
this component. It also registers to be woken up by the child if it
terminates.</p>
<p>This has a number of effects internally, and includes registering the
component as capable of recieving and sending messages. It doesn't give
the child a thread of control however!</p>
<p>You will want to call this function if you create child components of
your component.</p>
<h4 id="init__self-args-argd"><span
id="symbol-component.__init__">__init__(self, *args, **argd)</span></h4>
<p>You want to overide this method locally.</p>
<p>You MUST remember to call the superconstructor for things to work
however. The way you do this is: super(YourClass,self).__init__()</p>
<h4 id="str__self"><span
id="symbol-component.__str__">__str__(self)</span></h4>
<p>Provides a useful string representation of the component. You
probably want to override this, and append this description using
something like: 'component.__str__(self)'</p>
<h4 id="closedownmicroprocessself"><span
id="symbol-component._closeDownMicroprocess">_closeDownMicroprocess(self)</span></h4>
<p>Overrides original in microprocess class.</p>
<p>Ensures callbacks are deregistered, and all linkages created by this
component are destroyed.</p>
<h4 id="deliverself-message-boxname"><span
id="symbol-component._deliver">_deliver(self, message[,
boxname])</span></h4>
<p>For tests and debugging ONLY - delivers message to an inbox.</p>

*children)</span></h4>
<p>Register the specified component(s) as children of this component</p>
<p>This component will be woken if any of its children terminate.</p>
<p>Note that any children still need to be activated!</p>
<h4 id="anyreadyself"><span
id="symbol-component.anyReady">anyReady(self)</span></h4>
<p>Returns true if <em>any</em> inbox has any data waiting in it.</p>
<p>Used by a component to check an inbox for ready data.</p>
<p>You are unlikely to want to override this method.</p>
<h4 id="childcomponentsself"><span

<p>Returns true if data is available in the requested inbox.</p>
<p>Used by a component to check an inbox for ready data.</p>
<p>Call this method to periodically check whether you've been sent any
messages to deal with!</p>
<p>You are unlikely to want to override this method.</p>

**kwoptionalargs)</span></h4>
<p>Creates a linkage from one inbox/outbox to another.</p>
<p>-- source - a tuple (component, boxname) of where the link should
start from -- sink - a tuple (component, boxname) of where the link
should go to</p>
<p>Other optional arguments:</p>
<ul>
<li>passthrough=0 - (the default) link goes from an outbox to an
inbox</li>
<li>passthrough=1 - the link goes from an inbox to another inbox</li>
<li>passthrough=2 - the link goes from an outbox to another outbox</li>

<li>Call self.initialiseComponent()</li>
<li>Loop forever calling self.mainBody() yielding the return value each
time until mainBody() returns a False/zero result.</li>
<li>Call self.closeDownComponent()</li>
</ol>
<h4 id="mainbodyself"><span
id="symbol-component.mainBody">mainBody(self)</span></h4>
<p>Stub method. <strong>This method is designed to be
overridden.</strong></p>
<h4 id="recvself-boxname"><span id="symbol-component.recv">recv(self[,
boxname])</span></h4>
<p>returns the first piece of data in the requested inbox.</p>
<p>Used by a component to recieve a message from the outside world. All
comms goes via a named box/input queue</p>
<p>You will want to call this method to actually recieve messages you've
been sent. You will want to check for new messages using dataReady first
though.</p>
<p>You are unlikely to want to override this method.</p>
<h4 id="removechildself-child"><span
id="symbol-component.removeChild">removeChild(self, child)</span></h4>
<p>Deregister component as a child.</p>
<p>Removes the child component, and deregisters it from notifying us
when it terminates. Also removes any linkages this component has made
that involve this child.</p>
<p>You probably want to do this when you enter a closedown state of some
kind for either your component, or the child component.</p>
<h4 id="sendself-message-boxname"><span
id="symbol-component.send">send(self, message[, boxname])</span></h4>
<p>appends message to the requested outbox.</p>
<p>Used by a component to send a message to the outside world. All comms
goes via a named box/output queue.</p>
<p>You will want to call this method to send messages.</p>
<p>Raises <a href="/Docs/Axon/Axon.AxonExceptions.noSpaceInBox.html"
class="reference">Axon.AxonExceptions.noSpaceInBox</a> if this outbox is
linked to a destination inbox that is full.</p>
<p>You are unlikely to want to override this method.</p>
<h4 id="setinboxsizeself-boxname-size"><span
id="symbol-component.setInboxSize">setInboxSize(self, boxname,
size)</span></h4>
<p>boxname - some boxname, must be an inbox ; size - maximum number of
items we're happy with</p>
<h4 id="unlinkself-thecomponent-thelinkage"><span
id="symbol-component.unlink">unlink(self[, thecomponent][,
thelinkage])</span></h4>
<p>Destroys all linkages to/from the specified component or destroys the
specific linkage specified.</p>
<p>Only destroys linkage(s) that were created <em>by</em> this component
itself.</p>
<p>Keyword arguments:</p>
<ul>
<li>thecomponent -- None or a component object</li>
<li>thelinkage -- None or the linkage to remove</li>
</ul>
