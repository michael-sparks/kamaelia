<p>microprocess([thread][,closeDownValue]) -&gt; new microprocess object</p>
<p>Creates a new microprocess object (not yet activated). You can optionally specify an alternative generator to be used instead of the one the microprocess would ordinarily create for itself.</p>
<p>Keyword arguments:</p>
<ul>
<li>thread -- None, or an alternative generator to be the thread of execution in this microprocess.</li>
<li>closeDownValue -- Value to be returned when the microprocess has finished and _closeDownMicroprocess() is called (default=0)</li>
</ul>
</section>
<h3 id="methods-defined-here">Methods defined here</h3>
<h4 id="init__self-thread-closedownvalue-tag"><span id="symbol-microprocess.__init__">__init__(self[, thread][, closeDownValue][, tag])</span></h4>
<p>Microprocess initialiser.</p>
<p>Subclasses must call this using the idiom super(TheClass, self).__init__()</p>
<h4 id="str__self"><span id="symbol-microprocess.__str__">__str__(self)</span></h4>
<p>Standard function for rendering the object as a string.</p>
<h4 id="closedownmicroprocessself"><span id="symbol-microprocess._closeDownMicroprocess">_closeDownMicroprocess(self)</span></h4>
<p>Stub method that is overridden internally in Axon but not clients</p>
<p>Called by scheduler to ask microprocess to perform any desired shutdown tasks. The scheduler also processes any IPC objects in the return value.</p>
<h4 id="isrunnableself"><span id="symbol-microprocess._isRunnable">_isRunnable(self)</span></h4>
<p>Returns True if the microprocess is active and awake, or paused.</p>
<p>This query is actually passed on to this microprocess's scheduler.</p>
<h4 id="isstoppedself"><span id="symbol-microprocess._isStopped">_isStopped(self)</span></h4>
<p>Returns True if this microprocess has been running but has since been halted or terminated of its own accord. Otherwise returns False.</p>
<h4 id="microprocessgeneratorself-someobject-mainmethod"><span id="symbol-microprocess._microprocessGenerator">_microprocessGenerator(self, someobject[, mainmethod])</span></h4>
<p>This contains the mainloop for a microprocess, returning a generator object. Creates the thread of control by calling the class's main method, then in a loop repeatedly calls the resulting generator's next method providing the object with time slices. After each time slice, the _microprocessGenerator yields control back to its caller.</p>
<p>Keyword arguments:</p>
<ul>
<li>someobject -- the object containing the main method (usually 'self')</li>
<li>mainmethod -- <em>name</em> of the method that is the generator to be run as the thread.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="unpauseself"><span id="symbol-microprocess._unpause">_unpause(self)</span></h4>
<p>DEPRECATED - use M.unpause() instead</p>
<h4 id="activateself-scheduler-tracker-mainmethod"><span id="symbol-microprocess.activate">activate(self[, Scheduler][, Tracker][, mainmethod])</span></h4>
<p>Call to activate this microprocess, so it can start to be executed by a scheduler. Usual usage is to simply call x.activate()</p>
<p>You can optionally specify a specific scheduler or tracker to use (instead of the defaults). You can also specify that a different method is the 'main' generator.</p>
<p>Keyword arguments:</p>
<ul>
<li>Scheduler -- None to use the default scheduler; or an alternate scheduler.</li>
<li>Tracker -- None to use the default coordinating assistant tracker; or an alternative one.</li>
<li>mainmethod -- Optional. The name of the 'main' method of this microprocess (default="main")</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="mainself"><span id="symbol-microprocess.main">main(self)</span></h4>
<p>'main' thread of execution stub function. Client classes are expected to override this.</p>
<p>Write your replacement as a generator (a method with 'yield' statements in it). 'Yield' any non-zero values you like regularly to hand control to the scheduler so other microprocesses can get a turn at executing. Your code must therefore not block - eg. waiting on a system call or event.</p>
<p>If you miss this off a class that directly subclass's microprocess, your program will run, but it will not do what you want!</p>
<h4 id="nextself"><span id="symbol-microprocess.next">next(self)</span></h4>
<p>Calls next() of the internal generator - lets you drop a microprocess in somewhere where you'd ordinarily stick a generator.</p>
<p>Internally this calls self.__thread.next() to pass the timeslice down to the actual generator</p>
<h4 id="pauseself"><span id="symbol-microprocess.pause">pause(self)</span></h4>
<p>Pauses the microprocess.</p>
<p>If done by the microprocess itself, the microprocess will pause at the next point it 'yields'.</p>
<p>Internally, the request is forwarded to this microprocesses scheduler.</p>
<h4 id="runself"><span id="symbol-microprocess.run">run(self)</span></h4>
<p>run - starts the scheduler for this microprocess and runs it.</p>
<p>This is a convenient shortcut to activate and run this microprocess and any other microprocesses that have already been activated (with the same scheduler).</p>
<h4 id="stopself"><span id="symbol-microprocess.stop">stop(self)</span></h4>
<p>Halts the microprocess, no way to "unstop"</p>
<h4 id="unpauseself-1"><span id="symbol-microprocess.unpause">unpause(self)</span></h4>
<p>Un-pauses the microprocess.</p>
<p>This is provided to allow other microprocesses to 'wake up' this one. This can only be performed by an external microprocess - if you are paused there is no way you can unpause yourself!</p>
<p>Does nothing if microprocess has been stopped.</p>
<p>Internally, the request is forwarded to this microprocess's scheduler.</p>
