<p>March 2024 - This site, and Kamaelia are <a href="https://github.com/sparkslabs/kamaelia/issues/15">being updated</a>. There is significant work needed, and <a href="https://github.com/sparkslabs/kamaelia/pulls">PRs</a> are welcome.

<p><span style="font-size:24pt;font-weight:600">Modules
Overview</span></p>
<p>This file provides an overview of the current Kamaelia files, what
they are and where appropriate, how they work. This is designed to be a
living document, but not designed as raw API documentation. (There are
better ways of building API documentation) Essentially the purpose of
this documentis to act as "the next layer up" the documentation layers -
stating how and why the different parts are joined together.</p>
<ul>
<li>Base Modules</li>
<li>Internet Adaption Modules</li>
<li>Network Protocol Modules</li>
<li>UDP Components</li>
<li>Utility Modules</li>
</ul>
<p><span
style="font-family:Century Schoolbook L;font-style:italic;font-size:13pt;font-weight:600">Base
Modules</span></p>
<p>The purpose of <span
style="font-family:Courier 10 Pitch">__init__.py</span> is as usual to
allow the kamaelia modules to be imported in the traditional manner. It
is empty however, so explicit naming of submodules is needed after
import.</p>
<p><span
style="font-family:Courier 10 Pitch">KamaeliaExceptions.py</span>
contains a number of exceptions covering different potential failure
points in the modules. These exceptions generally inherit from <span
style="font-family:Courier 10 Pitch">AxonException</span>.</p>
<p><span style="font-family:Courier 10 Pitch">KamaeliaIPC.py</span>
however defines some specific payloads for intercomponent communication.
These are generally control messages used by various Internet Adaption
components for signalling various events - normally relating to new or
closed socket events. The IPC messages inherit from <span
style="font-family:Courier 10 Pitch">Axon.IPC</span>, and are mainly
notify events. Currently the only <span
style="font-family:Courier 10 Pitch">producerFinished</span>class is
<span style="font-family:Courier 10 Pitch">socketShutdown</span>- issued
by Internet Abstraction Modules.</p>
<p><span
style="font-family:Century Schoolbook L;font-style:italic;font-size:13pt;font-weight:600">Internet
Adaption Modules</span></p>
<p>These modules provide the basic primitives relating to network
handling. Essentially the</p>
<p>purpose of each file defines a basic primitive in a normal network
system.</p>
<p>As with the base Kamaelia package, <span
style="font-family:Courier 10 Pitch">__init__.py</span> is empty and
simply exists to allow package import as follows:</p>
<p>Clearly <span
style="font-family:Courier 10 Pitch">socketConstants.py</span> contains
a bunch of common constants - these aren't provided by the socket module
and largely cover error conditions, and are defined to increase code
readability.</p>
<p>The internet abstraction primitives can divided thus:</p>
<p>Connection Factories</p>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-family:Courier 10 Pitch">TCPServer.py</span> acts
as a factory spawning new connections which are handled by their own
components and will often have a protocol handler associated with
this.</li>
<li><span style="font-family:Courier 10 Pitch">TCPClient.py</span> also
acts as a factory, but only spawns one connected socket. It acts as a
data passthrough proxy for the subcomponent.</li>
</ul>
<div>

</div>
<div>
<p>Neither connection factory <span
style="font-style:italic">directly</span>handles any data to/from a
connected socket.</p>
</div>
<div>

</div>
<p>Specific Socket Handling:</p>
<p><span
style="font-family:Courier 10 Pitch">ConnectedSocketAdapter.py</span>
manages any connected socket.</p>
<ul>
<li>Any data recieved on its <span
style="font-family:Courier 10 Pitch">DataSend</span> inbox is sent to
the socket in a non-blocking fashion, and any data recieved from the
socket in a non-blocking fashion, is sent to the component outbox <span
style="font-family:Courier 10 Pitch">outbox</span>.</li>
<li>It only attempts to get data from the socket when it recieves an
appropriate message on its <span
style="font-family:Courier 10 Pitch">dataReady</span> inbox.</li>
<li>When it recieves a <span
style="font-family:Courier 10 Pitch">producerFinished</span> message on
its control port after having sent all outstanding <span
style="font-family:Courier 10 Pitch">dataSend</span> messages, it goes
into a shutdown mode. This results in shutdown messages being sent to
the <span style="font-family:Courier 10 Pitch">FactoryFeedback</span>
and <span style="font-family:Courier 10 Pitch">signal</span> outboxes.
This is due to the <span style="font-style:italic">ownership</span>of
the connected sockets being elsewhere.</li>
</ul>
<div>
<p>This simplicity allows the to be used <span
style="font-family:Courier 10 Pitch">ConnectedSocketAdapter</span> by
both the connection factories.</p>
</div>
<p>Multiple socket handling.</p>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-family:Courier 10 Pitch">Selector.py</span> is
designed for dealing with checking to see if any network connections are
active, and which <span
style="font-family:Courier 10 Pitch">ConnectedSocketAdapter</span>s need
to be told they can/should attempt to recieve data. When it detects a
server socket has a connection ready to be accepted it simply sends a
message to a dynamically allocated outbox to send the appropriate <span
style="font-family:Courier 10 Pitch">TCPServer</span> factory a message
to tell it to accept the connection.</li>
</ul>
<p>Other code:</p>
<p><span
style="font-family:Courier 10 Pitch">InternetConnection.py</span> is
legacy code and due to be ditched</p>
<p><span
style="font-family:Courier 10 Pitch">InternetHandlingTests.py</span> is
the current test code being used to drive integration between
client/server/selector service. This is a relatively complex
example:</p>
<ul>
<li>It creates a SimpleServer running and EchoProtocol, and a client
running an EchoCheckerProtocolComponent, and a TCPClient. The
EchoCheckerProtocolComponent is wired in to handle the application
communications. The client connects to the server making a complete
loop.</li>
</ul>
<p><span
style="font-family:Century Schoolbook L;font-style:italic;font-size:13pt;font-weight:600">Network
Protocol Modules</span></p>
<p>This directory contains a collection of modules, each implementing a
simple of not so simple network protocol. Some of this are designed as
toy protocols and were used during the design of the system to flesh out
key areas. As before, <span
style="font-family:Courier 10 Pitch">__init__.py</span> is simply an
empty file.</p>
<p>The only protocol here with a potential to be non-trivial is the
<span style="font-family:Courier 10 Pitch">HTTPServer.py</span>
protocol. The implementation inside that component at this point in time
is deliberately very simplistic, and only implements a very simple very
small subset of HTTP/1.0. When run standalone it runs a simple webserver
on port 8082, sending random files to the client. The server code isn't
actually complete. Also note that this is an <span
style="font-style:italic;font-weight:600">extremely</span><span
style="font-style:italic">insecure</span>web server as a result of these
two facts.</p>
<p><span
style="font-family:Courier 10 Pitch">EchoProtocolComponent.py</span> is
the simplest protocol implemented, and was unsurprisingly the first one
to be implemented - since it forms a simple loopback protocol useful for
integration testing. In practice this component is really a <span
style="font-style:italic">data pass through</span>component since all
data recieved on its inbox is passed on directly to its outbox. As a
result this component's implementation may actually migrate out to <span
style="font-family:Courier 10 Pitch">Kamaelia.Util</span> as a simple
buffer component and allow this actual protocol component to simply
inherit from <span
style="font-family:Courier 10 Pitch">Kamaelia.Util</span>.</p>
<p><span
style="font-family:Courier 10 Pitch">FortuneCookieProtocol.py</span> is
one step above <span
style="font-family:Courier 10 Pitch">EchoProtocolComponent.py</span>. It
runs the fortune program on the server and sends the result to its
outbox. In a networked environment what this means is the server will
simply blat the fortune cookie to a client that connects to the
server.</p>
<p><span
style="font-family:Courier 10 Pitch">AudioCookieProtocol.py</span> is a
logical extension to <span
style="font-family:Courier 10 Pitch">FortuneCookieProtocol.py</span>.
Similar to <span
style="font-family:Courier 10 Pitch">FortuneCookieProtocol.py</span> it
too runs an external program and sends the result to its outbox. In this
case however rather than a short piece of text, it is a short snippet of
audio.</p>
<p><span
style="font-family:Courier 10 Pitch">SimpleVideoCookieServer.py</span>
does essentially the same as <span
style="font-family:Courier 10 Pitch">FortuneCookieProtocol.py</span> and
<span
style="font-family:Courier 10 Pitch">AudioCookieProtocol.py</span>, but
this time with a short piece of video.</p>
<p><span
style="font-family:Century Schoolbook L;font-style:italic;font-size:13pt;font-weight:600">Utility
Modules</span></p>
<p>This is a small collection of utility components. They're designed as
simple filters for various uses - some perform simple, but useful
transformations that convert data into a format suitable for other
components, others are designed to be dropped in the middle of existing
linkages to allow debugging and/or output.</p>
<p><span style="font-family:Courier 10 Pitch">__init__.py</span> is as
usual an empty file for the usual reasons.</p>
<p><span style="font-family:Courier 10 Pitch">ConsoleEcho.py</span> is
designed to allow the system to take any data given on its inbox and
send it to stdout. It can also optionally forward the data recieved to
it's outbox meaning that it can be dropped in the middle of a linkage to
enable precise debugging when you wish to know what communications is
taking place.</p>
<p><span
style="font-family:Courier 10 Pitch">ToStringComponent.py</span>is a
simple filter component - it takes every object supplied via its inbox,
calls <span style="font-family:Courier 10 Pitch">str()</span> on the
object, and forwards the result to its outbox. This allows, for example,
a user to take the output of any component, convert it to a string
suitable for output to a console. This doesn't require the console
component to do the conversion (since someone may wish to send the
objects to a console as an easy way to check types), and doesn't require
components to provide special behaviour.</p>
<p><span
style="font-family:Century Schoolbook L;font-style:italic;font-size:13pt;font-weight:600">Multimedia
Modules</span></p>
<p>These three files are all related to the same purpose - playback of
audio, and also decoding ogg vorbis. There are some restrictions on some
of these, and there is a recommendation on which ones to use. Each of
these requires a set of libraries - these are covered below.</p>
<p><span style="font-family:Courier 10 Pitch">AOPlayer.py</span> is
deprecated, the actual component has moved location, and you really
ought not to use this at the moment. This may change at some point in
time.</p>
<ul>
<li>Requires <span style="font-family:Courier 10 Pitch">libao</span>,
and the <span style="font-family:Courier 10 Pitch">pyao</span> python
bindings.</li>
</ul>
<p><span
style="font-family:Courier 10 Pitch">oggFilePlayComponent.py</span>is
the oldest piece of code that can be used for decode and playback. It
uses the official xiph python bindings to decode ogg vorbis. On the
surface this is useful and if all you want to do is decode audio from a
file, this does work.</p>
<ul>
<li>There is a key restriction - it MUST come from a file object that
you have opened. It can't be something that looks like a file, it must
be a file. The reason for this is internally the xiph bindings dive into
the file object supplied, pull out the C filehandle and pass that over
to <span style="font-family:Courier 10 Pitch">libvorbisfile</span>.</li>
<li>Requires the following libraries: <span
style="font-family:Courier 10 Pitch">libao</span>, <span
style="font-family:Courier 10 Pitch">libogg</span>, <span
style="font-family:Courier 10 Pitch">libvorbis</span>, <span
style="font-family:Courier 10 Pitch">libvorbisfile</span></li>
<li>Requires the following python bindings: <span
style="font-family:Courier 10 Pitch">pyogg</span>, <span
style="font-family:Courier 10 Pitch">pyvorbis</span>, <span
style="font-family:Courier 10 Pitch">pyao</span></li>
</ul>
<p>This file contains the following components:</p>
<p><span style="font-family:Courier 10 Pitch">oggPlayer</span> - legacy
component - you used to be able to choose between AOPlayer and</p>
<p><span style="font-family:Courier 10 Pitch">PlayerComponent</span> -
This is an abstract class that provides the main functionality of a
player. Is is overridden by client subclasses. Subclasses are only
expect to override the <span
style="font-family:Courier 10 Pitch">write</span> method. The key method
in the payer component is a <span
style="font-family:Courier 10 Pitch">play</span> generator. Nastily,
this generator calls <span
style="font-family:Courier 10 Pitch">VorbisFile</span> to enable file
reading, unpacking of ogg and decode.</p>
<div>
<p>Current concrete subclasses:</p>
</div>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-family:Courier 10 Pitch">AOPlayer</span> - This
simply provides a <span
style="font-family:Courier 10 Pitch">write</span> method to send audio
to a <span style="font-family:Courier 10 Pitch">libao</span> audio
device.</li>
</ul>
<p>It's worth noting that the execution here is pretty ugly, and it was
the motivation for writing the next file. However, if all you want is to
use <span style="font-family:Courier 10 Pitch">libvorbisfile</span>,
<span
style="font-family:Courier 10 Pitch">oggFilePlayComponent.py</span> can
be useful.</p>
<p><span
style="font-family:Courier 10 Pitch">vorbisDecodeComponent.py</span> was
written to overcome the limitations metioned above. Specifically this
provides 2 components - one that will accept ogg vorbis data on an inbox
and provide back raw decoded audio on its outbox, and another that takes
audio on its inbox and plays the audio. This provides much cleaner
separation. The<span style="font-family:Cursor">testing spike included
shows how to use a file reading component in conjuction with these two
components to provide a file reading/decode chain.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:Cursor">The two components provided
are:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-family:Courier 10 Pitch">VorbisDecode</span><span
style="font-family:Cursor">- takes ogg vorbis encoded audio from its
inbox and provides raw decoded audio on its outbox.<br />
Important note: This is currently ogg vorbis - as you would read from a
file, NOT just vorbis encoded data.</span></li>
<li><span
style="font-family:Courier 10 Pitch">AOAudioPlaybackAdaptor</span><span
style="font-family:Cursor">- takes raw audio recieved on its inbox and
sends it to the audio device. Currently this may well be a blocking
operation. How to do this in a non-blocking manner is under
investigation. If it recieves a</span><span
style="font-family:Courier 10 Pitch">producerFinished</span><span
style="font-family:Cursor">message on its control inbox, this component
exits.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-family:Cursor">These components rely on the
following libraries being installed:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-family:Courier 10 Pitch">libogg</span><span
style="font-family:Cursor">,</span><span
style="font-family:Courier 10 Pitch">libao</span><span
style="font-family:Cursor">,</span><span
style="font-family:Courier 10 Pitch">libvorbis</span><span
style="font-family:Cursor">,</span><span
style="font-family:Courier 10 Pitch">libvorbissimple</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-family:Cursor">The python bindings required
are:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-family:Cursor">The python bindings supplied
with</span><span
style="font-family:Courier 10 Pitch">libvorbissimple</span></li>
<li><span style="font-family:Cursor">Pyrex is therefore also
required.</span></li>
</ul>

Usage:<br />
1. subclass bfrec<br />
2. Define a class var "fields"<br />
3. The value for this field should be a list of "field"s, created by
calling the static method field.mkList. This takes a list of tuples, one
