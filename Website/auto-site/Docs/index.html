<p><span style="font-weight:600">Please note:</span>The documentation here is lagging, quite badly at the moment, behind the bulk of Kamaelia, which is where all the interesting effort is going right now. Whilst everything you see here should largely still be valid, be aware that this really needs updating. We hope to rectify this ASAP. Good documenters very welcome!</p>
</div>
<p>Kamaelia's modules divide into 2 main sections:</p>
<p><a href="Axon.html">A core subsystem of modules</a> which provide the main concurrency support</p>
<ul>
<li>The core subsystem is suitable for use independently of Kamaelia itself, and is available as a separate download.</li>
</ul>
<p>Modules for Kamaelia itself.</p>
<p>This document is the starting point for Kamaelia itself.</p>
<p>This file provides an overview of the current Kamaelia files, what they are and where appropriate, how they work. This is designed to be a living document, but not designed as raw API documentation. (There are better ways of building API documentation) Essentially the purpose of this documentis to act as "the next layer up" the documentation layers - stating how and why the different parts are joined together.</p>

</ul>
<p><span style="font-family:Century Schoolbook L;font-style:italic;font-size:11pt;font-weight:600">Multimedia Modules</span></p>
<p>These three files are all related to the same purpose - playback of audio, and also decoding ogg vorbis. There are some restrictions on some of these, and there is a recommendation on which ones to use. Each of these requires a set of libraries - these are covered below.</p>
<p><span style="font-family:Courier 10 Pitch">AOPlayer.py</span> is deprecated, the actual component has moved location, and you really ought not to use this at the moment. This may change at some point in time.</p>
<ul>
<li>Requires <span style="font-family:Courier 10 Pitch">libao</span>, and the <span style="font-family:Courier 10 Pitch">pyao</span> python bindings.</li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-family:Courier 10 Pitch">oggFilePlayComponent.py</span>is the oldest piece of code that can be used for decode and playback. It uses the official xiph python bindings to decode ogg vorbis. On the surface this is useful and if all you want to do is decode audio from a file, this does work.</p>
<ul>
<li>There is a key restriction - it MUST come from a file object that you have opened. It can't be something that looks like a file, it must be a file. The reason for this is internally the xiph bindings dive into the file object supplied, pull out the C filehandle and pass that over to <span style="font-family:Courier 10 Pitch">libvorbisfile</span>.</li>
<li>Requires the following libraries: <span style="font-family:Courier 10 Pitch">libao</span>, <span style="font-family:Courier 10 Pitch">libogg</span>, <span style="font-family:Courier 10 Pitch">libvorbis</span>, <span style="font-family:Courier 10 Pitch">libvorbisfile</span></li>
<li>Requires the following python bindings: <span style="font-family:Courier 10 Pitch">pyogg</span>, <span style="font-family:Courier 10 Pitch">pyvorbis</span>, <span style="font-family:Courier 10 Pitch">pyao</span></li>
</ul>
<p>This file contains the following components:</p>
<p><span style="font-family:Courier 10 Pitch">oggPlayer</span> - legacy component - you used to be able to choose between AOPlayer and</p>
<p><span style="font-family:Courier 10 Pitch">PlayerComponent</span> - This is an abstract class that provides the main functionality of a player. Is is overridden by client subclasses. Subclasses are only expect to override the <span style="font-family:Courier 10 Pitch">write</span> method. The key method in the payer component is a <span style="font-family:Courier 10 Pitch">play</span> generator. Nastily, this generator calls <span style="font-family:Courier 10 Pitch">VorbisFile</span> to enable file reading, unpacking of ogg and decode.</p>
<div>
<p>Current concrete subclasses:</p>
</div>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-family:Courier 10 Pitch">AOPlayer</span> - This simply provides a <span style="font-family:Courier 10 Pitch">write</span> method to send audio to a <span style="font-family:Courier 10 Pitch">libao</span> audio device.</li>
</ul>
<p>It's worth noting that the execution here is pretty ugly, and it was the motivation for writing the next file. However, if all you want is to use <span style="font-family:Courier 10 Pitch">libvorbisfile</span>, <span style="font-family:Courier 10 Pitch">oggFilePlayComponent.py</span> can be useful.</p>
<p><span style="font-family:Courier 10 Pitch">vorbisDecodeComponent.py</span> was written to overcome the limitations metioned above. Specifically this provides 2 components - one that will accept ogg vorbis data on an inbox and provide back raw decoded audio on its outbox, and another that takes audio on its inbox and plays the audio. This provides much cleaner separation. The testing spike included shows how to use a file reading component in conjuction with these two components to provide a file reading/decode chain.</p>
<p>The two components provided are:</p>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-family:Courier 10 Pitch">VorbisDecode</span> - takes ogg vorbis encoded audio from its inbox and provides raw decoded audio on its outbox.<br />
Important note: This is currently ogg vorbis - as you would read from a file, NOT just vorbis encoded data.</li>
<li><span style="font-family:Courier 10 Pitch">AOAudioPlaybackAdaptor</span> - takes raw audio recieved on its inbox and sends it to the audio device. Currently this may well be a blocking operation. How to do this in a non-blocking manner is under investigation. If it recieves a <span style="font-family:Courier 10 Pitch">producerFinished</span> message on its control inbox, this component exits.</li>
</ul>
<p>These components rely on the following libraries being installed:</p>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-family:Courier 10 Pitch">libogg</span><span style="font-family:Cursor">,</span><span style="font-family:Courier 10 Pitch">libao</span><span style="font-family:Cursor">,</span><span style="font-family:Courier 10 Pitch">libvorbis</span><span style="font-family:Cursor">,</span><span style="font-family:Courier 10 Pitch">libvorbissimple</span></li>
</ul>
<p>The python bindings required are:</p>
<ul>
<li>The python bindings supplied with<span style="font-family:Cursor"></span><span style="font-family:Courier 10 Pitch">libvorbissimple</span></li>
<li>Pyrex is therefore also required.</li>
</ul>

<p>......</p>
<p><span style="font-family:Courier 10 Pitch">bitfieldrec.py -</span>Module containing utility functions to allow structures with arbitrary structures for bitstreams/bitfields. Currently only supports packing. Does not support unpacking (yet).Bit Field Record Support. Usage:<br />
1. subclass bfrec<br />
2. Define a class var "fields"<br />
3. The value for this field should be a list of "field"s, created by calling the static method field.mkList. This takes a list of tuples, one tuple per field. (fieldname, bitwidth, None or list)</p>
<p>class field(str)</p>
<ul>
<li>staticmethod mkList(fieldDefs)</li>
<li>fieldDefs = seq of (name, size,extra)</li>
</ul>
<p>class bfrec(AxonObject)</p>
<p>__init__(self, **args):</p>
<p>structureSize(self)</p>
<p>pack(self)</p>
<p>serialiseable(convert,aField) - Returns an iterable collection of values. (eg list) Either an existing one, or puts scalar/singleton values into a list. Doing this removes a special case.</p>
<p>Algorithm:</p>
<ul>
<li>This actually does need documenting properly. The algorithm was designed using test first approaches, and so is pretty solid, but documenting it would be a good idea. If only because it's actually quite nice :)</li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-family:Courier 10 Pitch">NullPayloadPreFramer.py</span> - .â€¦</p>
<ul>
<li>This Null payload also assumes constant bit rate load.</li>
</ul>
<p>Subcomponents functionality:</p>
<p>FileControl: - Only if RFA internal - isn't</p>
<ul>
<li>FileReader - only if internal - isn't</li>
<li>FileSelector - only if internal - isn't</li>
</ul>
<p>Format Decoding</p>
<p>DataFramaing</p>
<p>Command Interpreter (Likely to be component core code)</p>
