<p><span style="font-size: 16pt;">Build your own Kamaelia Core</span></p>
<p>It's interesting to note that there are two kinds of rich people in the world: those who made the money they have, and those who inherited it. Those who make it for themselves have often been noted to be greater risk takers than those who simply inherit. This is for the very simple reason - they've done it once, so they believe they can do it again.</p>
<p>Likewise when using any system, library, or framework, you're likely to have a better understanding of the system and how to better use it if you really understand how it works. That is you've written the system rather than someone else. Our preferred approach to date so far for teaching a novice how to use to Kamaelia has been to get them to write a version of the core concurrency system. This is framed as a series of exercises. After having built it, they realise that the system is really just a simple skein over simple programs.</p>
<p>Furthermore, this set of exercises has normally been done within less than 2 weeks of the novice learning python. If you're a new programmer, and you've learnt a certain core of python, you should be able to do and follow these exercises. It might look daunting, but it should be fine. If you get stuck, please feel free to come chat on IRC or on the mailing lists!</p>

<p><span id="Microprocess"></span><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-weight: 600;">1. Microprocesses - A Generator with Context</span></p>
<p>Axon is built on top of generators with some added context. Whilst the most common version of this a user actually uses is called a component, this is a specialisation of the general concept - a generator with context.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 600;">Exercise:</span> Write a class called <span style="font-family: Courier; font-weight: 600;">microprocess</span> (make sure you subclass "object" !) with the following methods:</p>
<p><span style="font-family: Courier;">__init__(self)</span></p>
<ul>
<li>Takes no arguments. (aside from self)</li>
<li>into this put any initialisation you might need</li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-family: Courier;">main(self)</span></p>
<ul>
<li>Takes no arguments. (aside from self)</li>
<li>This should be a generator that simply yields 1 value - specifically a 1</li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 600;">Answer:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 600;">Discussion:</span></p>
<p>Clearly we can create 5 of these now:</p>
<p>Calling their main method results in us being given a generator:</p>
<p>We can then run these generators in the usual way (though these are fairly boring microprocesses):</p>
<p>OK, so we have a mechanism for adding context to generators, and we've called that a microprocess. Let's make it simple to set lots of these running.</p>
<p><span id="Scheduler"></span><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-weight: 600;">2. Scheduler - A means of running lots of microprocesses</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 600;">Exercise:</span>Write a class called <span style="font-family: Courier; font-weight: 600;">scheduler</span> with the following characteristics.</p>
<ul>
<li>It should subclass microprocess.</li>
</ul>
<p>Objects created shold have the following attributes:</p>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-family: Courier;">self.active</span> - this is a list. (initially empty)</li>
<li><span style="font-family: Courier;">self.newqueue</span> - this is also a list. (initially empty)<br />
<span style="font-weight: 600;">Hint:</span>Initialise these in the __init__ method!</li>
</ul>
<p>Objects created should have the following methods:</p>
<p><span style="font-family: Courier;">__init__(self)</span> - Perform any initialisation you need here (see above)<br />
<span style="font-weight: 600;">Remember:</span>Don't forget to called your super class's __init__ method!</p>
<p><span style="font-family: Courier;">main(self)</span>- Takes no arguments<br />
This should be a generator with the following logic: (Looped 100 times)</p>
<p>Loop through all the objects in self.active using any mechanism you choose.</p>
<ul>
<li>IMMEDIATELY YIELD CONTROL HERE WITH a "non -1 value"</li>
<li>Suppose you call the current object (from self.active) current</li>
<li>Call current.next()</li>
<li>If a StopIteration exception is thrown, just catch and skip on to the next iteration. (eg continue)</li>
<li>If the result from current.next() was NOT -1, then append current onto self.newqueue</li>
</ul>
<p>Having looped through all the objects, REPLACE self.active with self.newqueue, and replace the value of self.newqueue with a new empty list</p>
<p><span style="font-family: Courier;">activateMicroprocess(self, someprocess)</span></p>
<ul>
<li>someprocess is a microprocess object (or anything that conforms to the same interface/behaviour seen by the scheduler).</li>
<li>This method should call the object's main method and append the result to self.newqueue</li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 600;">Answer:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 600;">Discussion:</span></p>
<p>This class provides us with a rudimentary way of activating generators embedded inside a class, adding them to a runqueue and then letting something run them. So let's try it. The default microprocess is relatively boring, so let's create some microprocesses that are little more than an age old program that repeatedly displays a messae. To do that we declare a class subclassing microprocess and provide a generator called main. We'll also capture a provided argument:</p>
<p>Note that this generator doesn't ever exit. We can then create a couple of these printers:</p>
<p>Next we can create a scheduler:</p>
<p>We can then ask this scheduler to activate the two microprocesses - X &amp; Y :</p>
<p>We can then run our scheduler by iterating through its main method:</p>
<p>If we run this we get the following output (middle of output snipped):</p>
<p>As you can see, the scheduler hits the 100th iteration and then halts.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-weight: 600;">3 Interlude</span></p>
<p>So far we've created a mechanism for giving a generator some implicit context by embedding it inside a microprocess class. We've also created a simple microprocess that repeatedly displays the same message over and over again. We've also created a simple mechanism for setting lots of microprocesses running and watching them just go.</p>
<p>This is all well and good and core aspects of Axon. However another core aspect is enabling these generators to talk to each other. Doing this means we can divide responsibility for a task between file reading, and display. The metaphor we choose to use in Axon is a very old one - that of a worker at a desk with a number of inboxes and a number of outboxes. The worker receives messages on his/her inboxes. He/She does some work, and send results on his/her outboxes. We can then have something that takes messages from an outbox (called saying "finance") and delivers them to the inbox of somewhere else (say the inbox "in" on the finance desk/component).</p>
<p>An alternate analogy we don't take here is one of computer chips with pins and wires. Signals would get sent to pins transmitted along the wires (links) to other pins on other chips. A more software oriented alternative is unix pipelines and standard file descriptors. A unix command line program always* has access to stdin, which it reads but has no idea of the source; stdout it can write to, but has no idea of destination (and stderr). Obviously however unix command line programs don't know if they're in a pipeline, or standalone.</p>
<p>The key point we have is <span style="font-style: italic;">active</span>objects talking only to local interfaces, and not knowing how those local interfaces are used.</p>
<p>So the next step is to first create this standard interface for external communications, and then a mechanism for allowing communication between these interface.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-weight: 600;">4<span id="Component"></span> Simple Component - Microprocesses with standard external interfaces</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 600;">Exercise:</span> Write a class called <span style="font-family: Courier; font-weight: 600;">component</span> that subclasses <span style="font-family: Courier;">microprocess</span> with the following...</p>
<p>Attributes:</p>
<p><span style="font-family: Courier;">self.boxes</span> - this should be a dictionary of the following form:</p>
<div>
<p>Clearly this allows for more inboxes and outboxes, but at this stage we'll keep things simple.</p>
</div>
<p>Behaviour: (methods)</p>
<p>As before an <span style="font-family: Courier;">__init__</span> for anything you need (eg attributes above :)<br />
</p>
<p><span style="font-family: Courier;">send(self, value, boxname)</span></p>
<p>This method takes the value and appends it to the end of the list associated with the boxname.</p>
<p>That is if I do:</p>
<div dir="ltr">
<p>Then given the suggested implementation of boxes above the following should be true afterwards:</p>
</div>
<div dir="ltr">
<p>ie the last value in the list associated with the boxname is the value we sent to that outbox. More explicitly, if the value of self.boxes was this beforehand:</p>
</div>
<div dir="ltr">
<p>And the following call had been made:</p>
</div>
<div dir="ltr">
<p>The self.boxes would look like this afterwards:</p>
</div>
<p><span style="font-family: Courier;">recv(self, boxname)</span></p>
<p>This is the logical opposite of sending. Rather than appending a value at the end of the send queue, we take the first value in the queue.</p>
<p>Behaviourally, given a starting value of self.boxes:</p>
<div dir="ltr">
<p>Then I would expect the following behaviour code.…</p>
</div>
<div dir="ltr">
<p>... to display the following sort of behaviour:</p>
</div>
<div dir="ltr">
<p>The value of self.boxes should also change as follows after each call:</p>
</div>
<p><span style="font-family: Courier;">dataReady(self, boxname)</span></p>
<p>This should return the length of the list associated with the boxname.<br />
<br />
For example, given:</p>
<div>
<p>The following behaviour is expected:</p>
</div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 600;">Answer:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 600;">Discussion:</span></p>
<p>Ok that's a fairly long description, but a fairly simple implementation. So what's this done? It's enabled us to send data to a running generator and recieve data back. We're not worried what the generator is doing at any point in time, and so the communications between us and the generator (or between generators) is asynchronous.</p>
<p>An extension to the suggested __init__ is to do the following:</p>
<p>This small extension means that classes subclassing <span style="font-family: Courier;">component</span> can have a different set of inboxes and outboxes. For example:</p>
<p>That said, components by themselves are relatively boring. Unless we have some way of moving the data between generators we haven't gained anything (really) beyond the printer example above. So we need someone/something that can move data/messages from outboxes and deliver to inboxes...</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-weight: 600;">5<span id="Postman"></span> Postman - A Microprocess that performs deliveries!</span></p>
<p>Given we have outboxes and inboxes, it makes sense to have something that can handle deliveries between the two. For the purpose of this exercise, we'll create a microprocess that can look at a single outbox for a single component, take any messages deposited there and pass them the an inbox of another component. In terms of the component implementation so far we can use <span style="font-family: Courier; font-weight: 600;">dataReady</span> to check for availability of messages, <span style="font-family: Courier; font-weight: 600;">recv</span> to collect the message from the outbox, and <span style="font-family: Courier; font-weight: 600;">send</span> to deliver the message to the recipient inbox.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 600;">Exercise:</span> Write a class called <span style="font-family: Courier; font-weight: 600;">postman</span> that subclasses <span style="font-family: Courier;">microprocess</span> with the following...</p>
<p>Attributes:</p>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-family: Courier;">self.source</span> - this should refer to the source component (expected type is to be a component)</li>
<li><span style="font-family: Courier;">self.sourcebox</span> - this should refer to the name of the source component's outbox to check. eg "outbox"</li>
<li><span style="font-family: Courier;">self.sink</span> - - this should refer to the destination (sink) component (expected type is to be a component)</li>
<li><span style="font-family: Courier;">self.sinkbox</span> - this should refer to the name of the sink component's inbox to check. eg "inbox"</li>
</ul>
<p>Behaviour: (methods)</p>
<p><span style="font-family: Courier;">__init__(self, source, sourcebox, sink, sinkbox)</span><br />
This should perform the following initialisation:</p>
<ul>
<li>Call the super class initialiser (<span style="font-weight: 600;">Hint:</span> keyword "super" in python docs, and pydoc)</li>
<li>set the attributes listed above :-)</li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-family: Courier;">main(self)</span><br />
This implements the behaviour described above:</p>
<p>In a loop</p>
<ul>
<li>yield control back periodically (eg <span style="font-family: Courier;">yield 1</span> is sufficient)</li>
<li>Check to see if <span style="font-family: Courier;">data</span> is <span style="font-family: Courier;">Ready</span> on the <span style="font-family: Courier;">source</span> component's <span style="font-family: Courier;">sourcebox</span>.</li>
<li>If there is <span style="font-family: Courier;">recv</span> the data from that box, and <span style="font-family: Courier;">send</span> it to the <span style="font-family: Courier;">sink</span> component's <span style="font-family: Courier;">sinkbox</span>.</li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 600;">Answer:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 600;">Discussion:</span></p>
<p>Given this, we can now start building interesting systems. We have mechanisms for enabling concurrency in a single process (microprocess &amp; scheduler), a mechanism for adding communications (postboxes) to a microprocess (component) and a mechanism for enabling deliveries between components. Whilst we (the Kamaelia team) can see from an optimised version that the postman can actually be optimised out of the system, this simple mini-axon shows the core elements of Kamaelia quite nearly in a microcosm.</p>
<p>One full version of this mini-axon can be found here: <a href="/MiniAxonFull.html">Mini Axon Full</a>, which should now be clear what it's doing how and why.</p>
<p>A simple example we can now create is a trivial system with one component creating some data and sending it to another one for display.</p>
<p>Running the above system then results in the following output:</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-weight: 600;">6 Interlude 2</span></p>
<p>If you've come this far, you may be wondering the worth of what you've acheived. Essentially you've managed to implement the core of a working Axon system, specifically on the most used aspects of the system. Sure, there is some syntactic sugar relating to creation and managing of links, but that's what it is - sugar.</p>
<p>One of the longer examples on the Kamaelia website, specifically in the blog area, is how to build new components. That's probably the next logical place to start looking. However, taking one of the components on that page, we find that the core implementation of them matches the same core API as the component system you've implemented.</p>
<p>For example, let's take a look at the multicast sender.</p>
<p>This has an initialiser for grabbing some initial values, and ensuring the super class's initialiser is called:</p>
<p>The main function/generator then is relatively simple - set up the socket, wait for data and send it out:</p>
<p>From this, it should be clear that this will work inside the mini-axon system you've created.</p>
<p>Similarly, we can create a simple file reading component thus:</p>
<p>This can then also be used using the component system you've just created to build a simplistic system for sending data to a multicast group:</p>
<p>That can then be activated and run in the usual way:</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-weight: 600;">7 Summary</span></p>
<p>This page has hopefully helped you build a core component system based on Kamaelia's Axon. It should be clear as well from this that the core of Kamaelia is actually quite small. We've found a number of aspects which we can optimise, add in syntactic sugar, and we're discovering that certain facilities are needed, and can be useful. However the raw core is simple - it's about generators communicating with inboxes and outboxes, and then building interesting systems on top of that.</p>
<p>The next step we'd normally recommend at this point is to build some interesting systems. Some exercises which will hopefully be helpful will appear as time progresses.</p>
