<p><span style="font-size:28pt;font-weight:600">Axon Release
Notes</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:21pt">1.5</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:21pt;font-weight:600">Summary</span></p>
<p>Axon 1.5 is a major performance related release for Kamaelia's core
component system. There have been a number of core changes, some
highlights:</p>
<p>Zero copy delivery of data from producers to consumers</p>
<p>The system scheduler is now reactive to threaded components, meaning
the system can truly sleep when there is nothing to do.</p>
<p>This means self.pause() REALLY pauses the microprocess, and may
result in the component not receiving data. (If you call self.pause, you
should really mean it). Generally this is only used at an optimisation
stage.</p>
<p>Threaded components are now fully supported with the following
caveats:</p>
<ul>
<li>They should not use the shared environment provided the
co-ordinating assistant tracker (they're not expected to need to do so,
but this is useful to make explicit)</li>
<li>They should not expect to be able to interact with synchronous boxes
(boxes with a maximum size)</li>
</ul>
<div>
<p>Aside from these caveats, creating and using a threaded component is
the same as a normal generator based one, except you simply don't have
yield statements. You obviously use a different base class.</p>
</div>
<p>The use of the "ipc" message Axon.Ipc.newComponent for child
component startup has been deprecated in favour of the simpler API:</p>
<p>Despite all these changes, components written for earlier versions of
Axon will continue to work as before.</p>
<p>Documentation has also generally improved,and is included in the the
code files for access via pydoc/help.</p>
<p><span style="font-size:21pt;font-weight:600">Changelog</span></p>
<p>Major subsystem changes aimed at performance enhancements</p>
<p><span style="font-weight:600">Message Passing and Delivery
Optimisation Changes</span></p>
<ul>
<li>Boxes are now discrete objects. This change has occured to enable
the use of direct (effectively "zero copy" delivery).</li>
<li>This has meant the postman has been deleted - components no longer
have a postman associated with them. This also dramatically frees up CPU
cycles for components rather than the communications system.</li>
<li>To replace the structural tracking, a "postoffice" class has been
created instead. This, however, is passive rather than active.</li>
<li>Because the death of a component no longer also means the death of a
postman, microprocess has been simplified to remove the concept of
activity creator. This removes the knock on complexity in both the
scheduler and inside Component.</li>
<li>Despite these changes components running on top of Axon (ie existing
Kamaelia components) operate largely unchanged. (A few that assumed the
existance of a postman etc have changed)</li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight:600">Flow Control Inversion</span></p>
<ul>
<li>The Scheduler therefore now dynamically builds its runqueue to only
include unpaused (active) microprocesses.</li>
<li>If there are no active microprocesses, the scheduler can now sleep.
Reducing CPU usage to zero, until some kind of event causes something to
wake up. Flow of control is therefore effectively inverted as Axon
systems can now be reactive.</li>
<li>Pausing state is now managed by the scheduler on behalf of
microprocesses (they used to manage it themselves). Requests to wake and
pause microprocesses get routed to the Scheduler.</li>
<li>The APIs for Component and Microprocess are, for the most part,
unchanged. Existing components will continue to work as before. If they
self pause they will benefit from reduced CPU usage. If all components
in a system behave in this way, then Axon will cease to busy-wait when
idle.</li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight:600">Threading Support</span></p>
<ul>
<li>The threaded component has had its API fixed to match the rest of
Axon (with the obvious exception of removing the yields).</li>
<li>Threaded 'adaptive' component is new.</li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight:600">Other</span></p>
<ul>
<li>Bug fix to make Wait* work cleaner</li>
</ul>
<p>Axon.Component.Component</p>
<ul>
<li>Default documentation for Component class in/out- boxes added</li>
<li>anyReady() added. Returns true if any has data in it.</li>
</ul>
<p>Axon.Microprocess.Microprocess</p>
<ul>
<li>Can activate an arbitrary thread of control from a generator (The
thing you normally call .next() on)</li>
<li>Can pass on a closeDownValue</li>
<li>Can be set as an activity creator</li>
<li>Now conditionally starts the thread. Actually helps with re-entrant
calls inside a single active microprocess.</li>
</ul>
<p>Axon.Scheduler.Scheduler</p>
<ul>
<li>Now handles shutdown knockons more gracefully</li>
<li>Removal of lots of debugging code no longer needed (hasn't been
needed in a long while)</li>
<li>Code cleanup</li>
</ul>
<p>Axon.Ipc</p>
<ul>
<li>Added the shutdown message. This can be used to request that an Axon
component should simply shutdown. This does not force the component to
shutdown, merely requests it.</li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight:600">Synchronous Links &amp; Link Tracing
API</span></p>
<p>As part of the changes to box optimisations, there has been a change
to the API for synchronous links. This is currently our best guess as to
what we think makes sense, but should be considered experimental until
Axon 2.0 (We'll endevour to keep the current API however for as long as
it makes sense).</p>
<p>When a synchronous link reaches maximum capacity, attempting to send
data to the synchronous link results in an exception being thrown. This
includes the current size of the pipe, and it's maximum capacity. The
exception thrown is as follows:</p>
<p><span style="font-size:21pt;font-weight:600">Detailed Changes to
files</span></p>
<p>Changes to Component class:</p>
<ul>
<li>Number of changes to support the newstyle boxes. (send now results
in direct delivery)</li>
<li>_collect method removed.</li>
<li>_deliver method deprecated (except for tests and debugging)</li>
<li>anyReady method added to check to see if any inbox has data
ready.</li>

<ul>
<li>An arbitrary generator can now be scheduled (using a wrapped
call).</li>
<li>Subclasses of microprocesses can now have a different named "main"
method.</li>

initialisation</li>
</ul>
<p>Adaptive inboxes changed into a mixin class:</p>
<ul>
<li>Reused in both Axon/AdaptiveCommsComponent.py and
Axon/ThreadedComponent.py</li>
<li>to provide adaptive inboxes for both generator based and thread
based components.</li>

<li>Axon/Microprocess.py</li>
</ul>
<p>Largely Rewritten or initial release:</p>

<li>Axon/ThreadedComponent.py</li>
<li>Axon/Scheduler.py</li>
</ul>
<p>Test suite moved out into separate tree. (being inside the
installation area doesn't seem to make sense)</p>
<ul>
<li>Axon/test/test_util.py</li>
<li>Axon/test/test_idGen.py</li>
<li>Axon/test/test_debugConfigFile.py</li>
