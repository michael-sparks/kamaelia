<h2 id="kamaelia-documentation">Kamaelia Documentation</h2>
<p>Documentation is a core asset in Kamaelia. As of Jan 2024, this is now being significantly updated.</p>
<p>While this is done you are invited to look at the <a href="/Components.html">Component Reference</a> for an indication of the scope of components, and the <a href="/Cookbook.html">Cookbook</a> for small examples.</p>
<h2 id="quick-overview">Quick Overview</h2>
<p>The <a href="/About.html">About</a> page is an overview of the project from a relatively high level.</p>
<h2 id="books">Books</h2>
<p>Two major pieces of Kamaelia documentation are booksized PDFs:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><a href="/downloads/20090619.KamaeliaPragmaticConcurrencyEuropython09.Final.pdf">The Kamaelia Europython tutorial</a>. This is an 84 page book teaching you the ideas behind Kamaelia, building your own core, building components and systems. <strong>This is probably the best place to start right now.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><a href="/PragmaticConcurrency.html">Pragmatic Concurrency</a> is an overview of this tutorial that also includes the slides to browse through.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><a href="/downloads/AxonKamaelia_docs.pdf">A newer &gt;400 page API reference book</a>, whose documentation autogenerated &amp; extracted from the codebase - covering both Axon and Kamaelia. (This is new as of Jan 2024 and a bit rough around the edges!)</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="cookbook"><a href="/Cookbook.html">Cookbook</a></h2>
<p>This section contains a number of recipes showing how to build a variety of different types of Kamaelia systems. Sections include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Linking components together</li>
<li>Building Network systems, clients, servers, IM, etc</li>
<li>Building Digital TV systems</li>
<li>Building Multimedia systems</li>
<li>Using Kamaelia components &amp; subsystems in non-kamaelia systems.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>More recipes always welcome.</strong></p>
<h2 id="api-references">API References</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="/Components.html">Full component Reference</a></li>
<li><a href="/Docs/Axon/Axon.html">Full reference for Axon - the core of Kamaelia</a></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="tutorials"><a href="/Tutorials.html">Tutorials</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>Dive into <a href="/Tutorials.html">Kamaelia tutorials from a variety of perspectives</a></li>
<li>See the <a href="/Presentations.html">presentations given publicly</a></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="kamaelia-based-systems">Kamaelia based systems</h2>
<p>There's quite a few Kamaelia systems as example applications in <a href="https://github.com/sparkslabs/kamaelia/tree/master/Code/Python/Apps">the repository on github</a>. Some sample apps:</p>
<h3 id="kamaelia-grey"><a href="/KamaeliaGrey.html">Kamaelia Grey</a></h3>
<p>Spam reduction through greylisting. Kamaelia Grey is a SMTP proxy for your inbound email, rejecting email likely to be spam. Mail likely to not be spam is forwarded to your normal mail server.</p>
<h3 id="batch-transcoder"><a href="/ActiveFileProcessor.html">Batch Transcoder</a></h3>
<p>This watches directories for new images and videos to transcode to formats suitable for the web. You can think of it as the backend needed for a youtube/flickr type site. PDF support is likely to be added soon.</p>
<h3 id="whiteboard"><a href="/Developers/Projects/Whiteboard.html">Whiteboard</a></h3>
<p>A collaborative whiteboard. 2 or more machines share a display you can write on - either can be a server. Whiteboards are paginated, and therefore can also be used for remote presentations. Really cool with a tablet.</p>
<h3 id="macro"><a href="/KamaeliaMacro.html">Macro</a></h3>
<p>Records and transcodes digital TV for later viewing (ie timeshifting). It can do this for as many channels at once as you have CPU power and tuners available for it.</p>
