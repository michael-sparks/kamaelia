<p>My main concern is with the home and introductory pages, because I
think they are very important, among other things, because for newcomers
they represent people behind the project and its activity and health. Is
like to give a good first impression. Why to focus on newcomers? In my
opinion, one of the main OS project goals is to attract visitors and
collaborators, show the best of the project and act like calling clients
in the bazaar. So I will focus mainly on those areas.<br />
<br />
- I like the idea of building the menu out of hexagons. In my opinion
the hexagon menu design (looks like a hive menu, but is that a flower?)
on the <a href="../../../Docs/.html">Documentation page</a> looks more
organized, I mean has cleaner visual composition than the one on the
home page.<br />
- I think that the "What is Kamaelia?" hexagon from the Documentation
page is important enough to be present on the home page.<br />
- I think that the OS projects that are driven by many people, must have
a presentation page that welcomes newcomers. This means that the home
page must have only the necessary links: I would omit the detailed
"Recent Changes" section, the Current Status and the Mailing lists
section on the home page so it may fit in one or two monitor screens. I
like very much the <a href="http://rubyonrails.com/">RubyonRails home
page</a>, but I do not mean that Kamaelia's web should look like just
another rails clone.<br />
- I guess any news are better than no news, specially if they are
located on the main page, so the project will look more active to
visitors (actual news are 5 months old).<br />
- When I visit a new site, in the HOME page, I automatically start
looking for a single menu containing names that look familiar, it is
like a pattern that I follow searching for links like, for example:
"about", "download", "contact us", "news", "documentation" "tutorials"
"case studies/use cases" "partners" "site map" "search" "blog" "wiki"
(well, the site is a wiki :))). While there are already most of those
links (I think the about link is a must), I guess they must be arrenged
in a clean menu, the hive of hexagons looks nice, but the links are
repeated from the text menu on the top right corner, I find that
redundancy confusing.<br />
I like the way pages like the <a href="../../../MiniAxon/">How</a> and
<a href="../../../Challenges/">Why</a> present their content. Maybe we
can present other web sections (i.e.Â Introduction, Tutorials, News) like
a storytelling, guiding the new visitor from page to page with brief
info and suggesting further reading when appropiate through links<a
href="../../../Challenges/"></a>. Introduction and tutorials may follow
the same model.<br />
Well that is what I observed. Maybe I am not very specific, but I think
the whole home page has to be rearrenged with newbies in mind. The
people familiar with the project may have less fancy and more technical
pages available deeper in the web tree.<br />
<br />
PD: Project Blog is not accesible and SummerOfCode still points to the
SOC 2006 page.<br />

Suggest we change the "LEARN what's under the hood" hexagon on the <a
href="../../../">home page</a> and <a href="../../../Docs/">docs
page</a> to link to <a href="../../../Docs/Axon.html">this page</a>
instead of directly to the <a href="../../../MiniAxon/">mini axon
tutorial</a>. Why? because some people (eg. me) might interpret it as
meaning go here for tutorials/learning/reference stuff about how
Axon/Kamaelia works. The suggested page still prominently directs people
to the mini axon tutorial, but also provides other options. To my mind,
it also places the tutorial into a context where they can subsequently
move on to find out more (ie. gives someone other places to go to when
they've done the tutorial)<br />

<p>I'd like to see a reference to the CDML codes the site uses.</p>
<ul>
<li><em>(Basic) reference to CDML added to the website here: <a
href="/Wiki.html">/Wiki</a></em> *-- Michael, 7th June.<br />
<br />

<ul>
<li></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>A search function would be really nice (but I know it may be a tad
hard to implement).</p>
<p>http://www.kamaelia.org/Developers/Projects/KamaeliaPublish/ and
http://www.kamaelia.org/Developers/Projects/KamaeliaPublish bring up two
different webpages.</p>
<ul>
<li><em>This is not a bug, this is by (conscious) design. You can make
then have the same text by doing an include. This is what <a
href="/Components.html">/Components</a> does.</em> *-- Michael, 7th
June.<br />
