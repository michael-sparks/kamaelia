<h1 id="cookbook-graphlines">Cookbook : Graphlines</h1>
<p>A Graphline provides a flexible way to link inboxes and outboxes in any way you wish. Whereas a Pipeline constrains your components to be wired into ... a pipeline ... with Graphline you specify each link explicitly.</p>
<p>Suppose we want to build a simple slideshow application, where pygame Button components control a Chooser component that sends filenames for each slide to a pygame Image display component:</p>
<p><img src="/images/graphline1_idea.gif" /></p>
<p>We could build this by writing a new component with a whole bunch of self.link() calls to link each outbox to the next inbox. But that is a lot of code to write and rather tedious! ... surely there must be an easier way?<br />
<br />
... You need the graphline component! No need to write a whole new component, simply use a Graphline component like this:</p>
<pre style="margin-left: 40px;"><code>from Kamaelia.Chassis.Graphline import Graphline

from Kamaelia.UI.Pygame.Button import Button
from Kamaelia.UI.Pygame.Image import Image
from Kamaelia.Util.Chooser import Chooser

files = [ &quot;slide1.gif&quot;, &quot;slide2.gif&quot;, .... &quot;slide99.gif&quot; ]

Graphline(
     CHOOSER  = Chooser(files),
     IMAGE    = Image(size=(800,600), position=(8,48)),
     NEXT     = Button(caption=&quot;Next&quot;,     msg=&quot;NEXT&quot;, position=(72,8)  ),
     PREVIOUS = Button(caption=&quot;Previous&quot;, msg=&quot;PREV&quot; ,position=(8,8)   ),
     FIRST    = Button(caption=&quot;First&quot;,    msg=&quot;FIRST&quot;,position=(256,8) ),
     LAST     = Button(caption=&quot;Last&quot;,     msg=&quot;LAST&quot; ,position=(320,8) ),

     linkages = {
        (&quot;NEXT&quot;,     &quot;outbox&quot;) : (&quot;CHOOSER&quot;, &quot;inbox&quot;),
        (&quot;PREVIOUS&quot;, &quot;outbox&quot;) : (&quot;CHOOSER&quot;, &quot;inbox&quot;),
        (&quot;FIRST&quot;,    &quot;outbox&quot;) : (&quot;CHOOSER&quot;, &quot;inbox&quot;),
        (&quot;LAST&quot;,     &quot;outbox&quot;) : (&quot;CHOOSER&quot;, &quot;inbox&quot;),

        (&quot;CHOOSER&quot;,  &quot;outbox&quot;) : (&quot;IMAGE&quot;,   &quot;inbox&quot;),
     }
).run()</code></pre>
<p>What you see here is slightly abridged for clarity. You can find the full version in <code>Kamaelia/Examples/SimpleGraphicalApps/Slideshows</code></p>
<p>What did we just do? Simple:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Write each component as a named argument<br />
</p>
<pre style="margin-left: 40px;"><code>     CHOOSER  = Chooser(files),
     IMAGE    = Image(size=(800,600), position=(8,48)),
     NEXT     = Button(caption=&quot;Next&quot;,     msg=&quot;NEXT&quot;, position=(72,8)  ),
     PREVIOUS = Button(caption=&quot;Previous&quot;, msg=&quot;PREV&quot; ,position=(8,8)   ),
     FIRST    = Button(caption=&quot;First&quot;,    msg=&quot;FIRST&quot;,position=(256,8) ),
     LAST     = Button(caption=&quot;Last&quot;,     msg=&quot;LAST&quot; ,position=(320,8) ),</code></pre>
<p><br />
</p></li>
<li><p>...then write the linkages you want as the 'linkages' argument in a dictionary:<br />
</p>
<pre style="margin-left: 40px;"><code>     linkages = {
        (&quot;NEXT&quot;,     &quot;outbox&quot;) : (&quot;CHOOSER&quot;, &quot;inbox&quot;),
        (&quot;PREVIOUS&quot;, &quot;outbox&quot;) : (&quot;CHOOSER&quot;, &quot;inbox&quot;),
        (&quot;FIRST&quot;,    &quot;outbox&quot;) : (&quot;CHOOSER&quot;, &quot;inbox&quot;),
        (&quot;LAST&quot;,     &quot;outbox&quot;) : (&quot;CHOOSER&quot;, &quot;inbox&quot;),

        (&quot;CHOOSER&quot;,  &quot;outbox&quot;) : (&quot;IMAGE&quot;,   &quot;inbox&quot;),
     }</code></pre></li>
</ol>
<p>For each linkage we want, we write a mapping in the dictionary from a (component, outbox) to a (component, inbox) We refer to the components by the names we just gave them, as strings. We reference the inboxes and outboxes by their names too.</p>
<p>So, for example:<br />
</p>
<pre style="margin-left: 40px;"><code>(&quot;NEXT&quot;,&quot;outbox&quot;) : (&quot;CHOOSER&quot;,&quot;inbox&quot;)</code></pre>
<p>specifies that you want the "outbox" outbox of the "Next" Button to be linked to the "inbox" inbox of the Chooser.<br />
<br />
</p>
<h3 id="making-links-to-the-outside-world">Making links to the outside world</h3>
<p>So the Graphline defined above wires up the Chooser, Image and 4 Button components inside itself - like Pipeline it is a kind of container:<br />
</p>
<div data-align="center">
<p><img src="/images/graphline1_intention.gif" /><br />
</p>
</div>
<p><br />
If we look in more detail, the links made are actually like this:<br />
<br />
</p>
<div style="text-align: center;">
<figure>
<img src="../../../images/graphline1_inside.gif" alt="" /><figcaption>A diagram showing how the components inside the example graphline are linked up</figcaption>
</figure>
</div>
<p><br />
Just like the Pipeline component, a Graphline has its own inboxes and outboxes. You can specify links to and from these by using the empty string to name the component.<br />
<br />
For example, we might want to be able to send instructions to the Chooser from outside this graphline, in which case we would add this to the set of linkages:<br />
</p>
<pre style="margin-left: 40px;"><code>        (&quot;&quot;, &quot;inbox&quot;) : (&quot;NEXT&quot;, &quot;inbox&quot;),</code></pre>
<p>By using a name for a component that we've not used (in this case simply the empty string suffices) we're telling Graphline to use its own inbox.<br />
<br />
We could do the same for outboxes too if we want. For example, we could ask for the outbox of the Image component to be linked to the Graphline's outbox:<br />
</p>
<pre style="margin-left: 40px;"><code>        (&quot;IMAGE&quot;, &quot;outbox&quot;) : (&quot;&quot;,     &quot;outbox&quot;),</code></pre>
<p>In fact, if you also refer to an inbox or outbox name for the Graphline that does not exist. Graphline will simply create it. This means you can use a Graphline as a container, giving it whatever inboxes and outboxes you need - not just the 'standard' ones that most components have.<br />
<br />
Just like with Pipeline, Graphline is a fully fledged component itself, so you can put a Graphline inside a Pipeline, or a Pipeline inside a Graphline, or any other combination you care to choose. Again, it can be a good way of making your system more modular, by separating off a little group of components into a separate functional unit.<br />
