<h1 id="run-components-one-after-the-other-in-sequence-275">Run components one after the other (in sequence) {#275}</h1>
<p>A Seq component runs components one after the other in sequence, waiting until one terminates before starting the next.</p>
<p>Strings can also be put in the sequence. They'll be printed to the console</p>
<h2 id="example-usage-276"><span id="example-usage">Example Usage</span> {#276}</h2>
<p>Run several OneShot components running one after the other:</p>
<pre class="literal-block"><code>Pipeline( Seq( &quot;BEGIN SEQUENCE&quot;,
               OneShot(&quot;Hello\n&quot;),
               OneShot(&quot;Doctor\n&quot;),
               OneShot(&quot;Name\n&quot;),
               OneShot(&quot;Continue\n&quot;),
               OneShot(&quot;Yesterday\n&quot;),
               OneShot(&quot;Tomorrow\n&quot;),
               &quot;END SEQUENCE&quot;,
             ),
          ConsoleEchoer(),
        ).run()</code></pre>
<p>Running this generates the following output:</p>
<pre class="literal-block"><code>BEGIN SEQUENCE
Hello
Doctor
Name
Continue
Yesterday
Tomorrow
END SEQUENCE</code></pre>
<h2 id="behaviour-277"><span id="behaviour">Behaviour</span> {#277}</h2>
<p>Each component in the sequence is activated as a child component and is wired up so that the "inbox" inbox and "outbox" outbox are forwarded to the "inbox" inbox and "outbox" outbox of the Seq component itself.</p>
<p>When the child component terminates it is replaced with the next in the sequence.</p>
<p>If a string is listed instead of a component then it is printed on the console and Seq immediately moves onto the next in the sequence.</p>
<p>Any messages sent out of the child component's "signal" outbox are dropped - this is so that if you Pipeline a Seq component to another, it does not cause it to terminate when the Seq component switches to a new child.</p>
<p>This component ignores any messages sent to its "control" inbox.</p>
<p>When the end of the sequence is reached, a producerFinished() message is sent out of the "signal" outbox and the component terminates.</p>

<p>Seq(*sequence) -&gt; new Seq component.</p>
<p>Runs a set of components in sequence, one after the other. Their "inbox" inbox and "outbox" outbox are forwarded to the "inbox" inbox and "outbox" outbox of the Seq component.</p>
<p>Keyword arguments:</p>

<li>*sequence -- Components that will be run, in sequence. Can also include strings that will be output to the console.</li>

<p><strong>Warning!</strong></p>
<p>You should be using the inbox/outbox interface, not these methods (except construction). This documentation is designed as a roadmap as to their functionalilty for maintainers and new component developers.</p>
