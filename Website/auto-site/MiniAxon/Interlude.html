<p>March 2024 - This site, and Kamaelia are <a href="https://github.com/sparkslabs/kamaelia/issues/15">being updated</a>. There is significant work needed, and <a href="https://github.com/sparkslabs/kamaelia/pulls">PRs</a> are welcome.

<p><span style="font-size:14pt;font-weight:600">3 Interlude</span></p>
<p>So far we've created a mechanism for giving a generator some implicit
context by embedding it inside a microprocess class. We've also created
a simple microprocess that repeatedly displays the same message over and
over again. We've also created a simple mechanism for setting lots of
microprocesses running and watching them just go.</p>
<p>This is all well and good and core aspects of Axon. However another
core aspect is enabling these generators to talk to each other. Doing
this means we can divide responsibility for a task between file reading,
and display. The metaphor we choose to use in Axon is a very old one -
that of a worker at a desk with a number of inboxes and a number of
outboxes. The worker receives messages on his/her inboxes. He/She does
some work, and send results on his/her outboxes. We can then have
something that takes messages from an outbox (called saying "finance")
and delivers them to the inbox of somewhere else (say the inbox "in" on
the finance desk/component).</p>
<p>An alternate analogy we don't take here is one of computer chips with
pins and wires. Signals would get sent to pins transmitted along the
wires (links) to other pins on other chips. A more software oriented
alternative is unix pipelines and standard file descriptors. A unix
command line program always* has access to stdin, which it reads but has
no idea of the source; stdout it can write to, but has no idea of
destination (and stderr). Obviously however unix command line programs
don't know if they're in a pipeline, or standalone.</p>
<p>The key point we have is <span
style="font-style:italic">active</span>objects talking only to local
interfaces, and not knowing how those local interfaces are used.</p>
<p>So the next step is to first create this standard interface for
external communications, and then a mechanism for allowing communication
between these interface.</p>
