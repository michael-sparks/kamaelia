<p>Feb 2024 - This site, and Kamaelia are <a href="https://github.com/sparkslabs/kamaelia/issues/15">being updated</a>. There is significant work needed, and <a href="https://github.com/sparkslabs/kamaelia/pulls">PRs</a> are welcome.

<p><span id="Microprocess"></span><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-weight: 600;">1. Microprocesses - A Generator with Context</span></p>
<p>Axon is built on top of generators with some added context. Whilst the most common version of this a user actually uses is called a component, this is a specialisation of the general concept - a generator with context.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 600;">Exercise:</span> Write a class called <span style="font-family: Courier; font-weight: 600;">microprocess</span> (make sure you subclass "object" !) with the following methods:</p>
<p><span style="font-family: Courier;">__init__(self)</span></p>
<ul>
<li>Takes no arguments. (aside from self)</li>
<li>into this put any initialisation you might need</li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-family: Courier;">main(self)</span></p>
<ul>
<li>Takes no arguments. (aside from self)</li>
<li>This should be a generator that simply yields 1 value - specifically a 1</li>
</ul>

<p><span style="font-weight:600">Answer:</span></p>
<ul>
<li>Select from the above tabs to show the answer!</li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 600;">Discussion:</span></p>
<p>Clearly we can create a handful of these now:</p>
<p>Calling their main method results in us being given a generator:</p>
<p>We can then run these generators in the usual way (though these are fairly boring microprocesses):</p>
<p>OK, so we have a mechanism for adding context to generators, and we've called that a microprocess. Let's make it simple to set lots of these running.</p>
