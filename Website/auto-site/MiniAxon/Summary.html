<p>Feb 2024 - This site, and Kamaelia are <a href="https://github.com/sparkslabs/kamaelia/issues/15">being updated</a>. There is significant work needed, and <a href="https://github.com/sparkslabs/kamaelia/pulls">PRs</a> are welcome.

<p><span style="font-size:14pt;font-weight:600">7 Summary</span></p>
<p>This tutorial has hopefully helped you build a core component system based on Kamaelia's Axon. It should be clear as well from this that the core of Kamaelia is actually quite small. We've found a number of aspects which we can optimise, add in syntactic sugar, and we're discovering that certain facilities are needed, and can be useful. However the raw core is simple - it's about generators communicating with inboxes and outboxes, and then building interesting systems on top of that.</p>
<p>The next step we'd normally recommend at this point is to build some interesting systems. Some exercises which will hopefully be helpful will appear as time progresses.</p>
