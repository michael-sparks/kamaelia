<p>March 2024 - This site, and Kamaelia are <a href="https://github.com/sparkslabs/kamaelia/issues/15">being updated</a>. There is significant work needed, and <a href="https://github.com/sparkslabs/kamaelia/pulls">PRs</a> are welcome.

<h1 id="wiki---no-more">Wiki - no more</h1>
<p>Back in the day, it was common to create websites using a wiki as a
CMS. This site used to do this so, so this page, previously documented
how to do this.</p>
<p>These days, this site is statically generated HTML from markdown
files, which are managed via git. This isn’t to say this will always be
the case, but that’s what is currently being done/changed to (as of Feb
2024).</p>
<p>If you’re arriving here from another page, expecting a wiki to be
here, apologies, and <a
href="https://github.com/sparkslabs/kamaelia/issues">could you file an
issue please?</a></p>
