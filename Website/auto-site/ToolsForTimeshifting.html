<p><span style="font-size:18pt">Make use of your TV</span></p>
<p>This is the directly related to the current focus of some of our work.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight:600">Note:</span>Timeshifting is defined (in the UK), along the lines of as being you recording something at your home off the TV for you to watch (probably once) at a more convenient time. One of the spin offs from some existing internal work will be that it provides a number of tools that make timeshifting easier. Please note, this page won't contain any legal advice, and these tools are <span style="font-style:italic">only</span> provided for legal timeshifting! If you've any doubt what these terms mean, or think you might get it wrong, please consult a lawyer ! If you're located in a country where timeshifting isn't protected by law, don't use these tools.</p>
