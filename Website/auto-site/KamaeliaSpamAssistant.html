<p>Feb 2024 - This site, and Kamaelia are <a href="https://github.com/sparkslabs/kamaelia/issues/15">being updated</a>. There is significant work needed, and <a href="https://github.com/sparkslabs/kamaelia/pulls">PRs</a> are welcome.

<div class="boxright">
<p>If you run your own SMTP server, you can stop a lot of spam before it hits your mailbox by using <a href="/KamaeliaGrey.html">KamaeliaGrey</a></p>
</div>
<p>This tool is a work in progress and has already assisted in the deletion of several thousand spams repaying it's development cost immediately.<br />
It's purposes is to delete spam on a POP3 server before downloading the spam. It does this by examining headers. It is currently a first pass designed to assist clearing my current inbox which has reach silly proportions.<br />
The code is nowhere near perfect Kamaelia code and does things Kamaelia systems shouldn't really, but that's not the point - these things can (and will) be tidied up. The site hosting the phrases.txt file also needs to provide a mechanism of allowing for shared (trusted) updates of the phrases.txt file.<br />
</p>
<h2 id="getting-it"><strong>Getting it</strong></h2>
<p>It is not yet packaged up - you'll need to use SVN to grab it.<br />
<a href="https://kamaelia.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/kamaelia/trunk/Sketches/MPS/POP3/spam_deletion_assistant.py" class="uri">https://kamaelia.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/kamaelia/trunk/Sketches/MPS/POP3/spam_deletion_assistant.py</a><br />
svn co https://kamaelia.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/kamaelia/trunk/Sketches/MPS/POP3<br />
To install and use it you'll need a copy of Kamaelia &amp; Axon. The easiest way is to grab a copy of <a href="/KamaeliaGrey.html">Kamaelia Grey</a> (link on that page :-) )<br />
