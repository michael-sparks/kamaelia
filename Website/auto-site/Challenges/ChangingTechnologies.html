<p>March 2024 - This site, and Kamaelia are <a href="https://github.com/sparkslabs/kamaelia/issues/15">being updated</a>. There is significant work needed, and <a href="https://github.com/sparkslabs/kamaelia/pulls">PRs</a> are welcome.

<p><span style="font-size:22pt;font-weight:600">Changing
Technologies</span></p>
<p>Network delivery speeds to the home have increased 10 fold over the
past 10 years. Home storage capabilities have increased 1000 fold over
the same time period. Mobile phones <span
style="font-weight:600">have</span> become the true converged ubiquitous
computing platforms, with gigabytes of storage, 3D visual capabilities,
and video/audio recording and playback.</p>
<p>&gt; media consumption devices</p>
<p>Computers <span style="font-weight:600">have</span> shrunk to
laptops, intelligent displays, pen and touch screens. Home entertainment
platforms have gone from multichannel TV with simple computer games to
near interactive 3D movies, gesture based input, surround sound audio
and entire collections of video fitting inside ring binder sized
wallets.</p>
<p>There is currently reason to believe that these trends will continue
over the next 10 years. Home network delivery speeds will continue to
rise relatively slowly, but at least 10 fold. Storage may continue to
grow at a rate of1000 fold per decade. Incredible as this seems today,
this means that even a laptop may be capable of storing dozens of
terabytes.</p>
<p>Devices will continue to become more personal, and current esoteric
platforms, such as paper with e-ink may become more common. Connectivity
to and from these devices will become faster, more convenient and
movement of data between devices will be an <span
style="font-weight:600">expectation</span>, not a privilege. If content
providers do not enable this, the people will enable it for themselves,
sharing their results.</p>
<p>3D interactive capabilities of "games" consoles will become film
quality, leading to an escalation of format wars leading beyond 2D
gesture capabilities to full 3D resolution and scene recognition. Camera
integration is leading to video phone style systems becoming common
place, very soon. Speech recognition will become common place.
Audio/Video search will take on a brute force approach, supplementing
and often replacing metadata approaches of the past.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight:600">It is into this environment the BBC
will be delivering its content.</span></p>
