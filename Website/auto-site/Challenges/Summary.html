<p>March 2024 - This site, and Kamaelia are <a href="https://github.com/sparkslabs/kamaelia/issues/15">being updated</a>. There is significant work needed, and <a href="https://github.com/sparkslabs/kamaelia/pulls">PRs</a> are welcome.

<p><span style="font-size:24pt;font-weight:600">Summary</span></p>
<p>The key aim is to pull people's awareness towards specific key
problems which are thought to be very difficult, but achievable in a
decade or two.</p>
<p>The sheer scale and scope of the problems caused by 20-60 million
different items of content to be viewed <span
style="font-style:italic">simultaneously</span> from the BBC,
potentially online is a challenge that should be undertaken, but should
not be undertaken lightly.</p>
<p>There <span style="font-style:italic">are</span> BBC projects
underway looking at these challenges, but the scope of this document is
larger. The challenges laid out in this document will exist, and need
resolving - whether the BBC does it or asks industry to help. Clearly
the ultimate solution will be a mix of both in areas of appropriate
expertise.</p>
<p><span style="font-size:22pt;font-weight:600">Meeting
Challenges</span></p>
<p>BBC R&amp;D projects exist that seek to address some of the issues
laid out here. The <a
href="http://kamaelia.sourceforge.net/">Kamaelia</a> &amp; <a
href="http://dirac.sourceforge.net/">Dirac</a> projects are aimed
specifically at the some of the challenges in this document. BBC and
Industry collaborations such as <a
href="http://www.hitech-projects.com/euprojects/share_it/">Share It!</a>
have been looking at issues related to these challenges. Some of these
challenges naturally fit elsewhere with other groups.</p>
<p>However, the reality is that the BBC and industry cannot assume that
the public will follow. P2P has shown that the Internet Community - that
is anyone competent, willing and connected to the network - will go
their own way if the public is not involved. There is almost always a
better way.</p>
<hr />
<p>The style of this document is inspired by the "<a
href="http://www.bcs.org/BCS/Awards/Events/GrandChallenges/conferencereports.htm">Grand
Challenges in Computing</a>" documents produced by UK Academia. These
grand challenges have a long history. One notable success in recent
times has been the Human Genome Project. A project that was successful
at driving forward state of the art, but that which ultimately failed in
it's original goal was Hilbert's Grand Challenge to Mathematics around
1900.</p>
