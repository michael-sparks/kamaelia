<p>March 2024 - This site, and Kamaelia are <a href="https://github.com/sparkslabs/kamaelia/issues/15">being updated</a>. There is significant work needed, and <a href="https://github.com/sparkslabs/kamaelia/pulls">PRs</a> are welcome.

Desire for Quality</span></p>
<p>The growth in network upload capacity for servers will help mitigate
BBC distribution costs from a central location. However growth in
download capacity by our audience's tumbling costs will wipe out any
savings.</p>
<p>No documents match your search</p>
<p>Traditionally the BBC has aimed to send the best quality audio and
video services that the user can receive. Over dialup we provided video
at download speeds that fit over a dialup. For the Olympics - we assumed
that broadband users have 10 times that capacity. As a result we
provided video 10 times larger and much closer to the casual observer to
digital TV quality (10 times more on both sides).</p>
<p>In years to come home download speeds will grow 10 fold. Our audience
will be able and expect to, receive HDTV quality video over broadband.
Likewise the BBC will also want to deliver this quality. Upload capacity
would need to grow 10 fold again, <span style="font-style:italic">simply
to service the current audience size - eliminating savings in upload
costs for the older poorer quality.</span></p>
<p>As every person buying broadband knows - greater capacity costs more.
Simply changing from 2-4 million streams <span
style="font-style:italic">per day</span> to 2-4 million users <span
style="font-style:italic">per second</span> means our upload capacity
means costs to the license fee payer grow dramatically. Grow that 10
fold again, and you get a very large number indeed!</p>
<p>Since Moore's law doesn't really help us, any work we can do to
reduce the need for users to user their full download capacity saves us
money. Reducing the bandwidth required for HDTV quality video will
enable the BBC to provide the audience with higher quality video using a
flexible, scalable approach.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight:600">Challenge:</span> To find a way of
capping the <span style="font-style:italic">need</span> for bandwidth
usage on the client end. This may mean that research into higher quality
video in smaller and smaller bit rates becomes ever more important to
allow the BBC to remove Moore's law from the client side of the
equation.</p>
