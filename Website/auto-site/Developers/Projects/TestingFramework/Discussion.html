<p>Feb 2024 - This site, and Kamaelia are <a href="https://github.com/sparkslabs/kamaelia/issues/15">being updated</a>. There is significant work needed, and <a href="https://github.com/sparkslabs/kamaelia/pulls">PRs</a> are welcome.

<h1 id="developersprojectstestingframeworkdiscussion">Developers/Projects/TestingFramework/Discussion</h1>
<p>These are ideas gathered for the testing framework. This ideas are still being discussed, I just write this wiki page to be able to effectively reference them in an easy way (saying [foo1] instead of saying "that thing Foo said in the list that day..."). I'll update this page during the discussion.<br />
<br />
</p>
<h2 id="convention">Convention</h2>
<p><br />
I'm using the convention [xxxY] being xxx the first three letters of the nick of somebody and Y the number of the idea of this someone.<br />
<br />
[orp?] -&gt; orphans<br />
[dav?] -&gt; Davbo<br />
[law?] -&gt; Lawouach<br />
[cho?] -&gt; Chong<br />
[jba?] -&gt; j_baker<br />
<br />
</p>
<h2 id="ideas">Ideas</h2>
<p><br />
So the ideas, if I understood them correctly, are:<br />
<br />
  [orp1] Provide a given input to a components and check the outputs to check that the format is correct.<br />
  [orp2] Make sure that when you ask for it, it finishes.<br />
  [orp3] Check that a component has called the pause() method at some time<br />
<br />
  [dav1] A random set of pygame interrupts to the display<br />
  [dav2] A logging engine that can be enable/disable certain components so you can keep the printing of the messages in the code, but it will just not be showed if not wanted.<br />
<br />
  [law1] Be able to unit test components independently.<br />
<br />
  [cho1] Provide inputs for the component and expect output from it.<br />
  [cho2] Check variables in runtime.<br />
  [cho3] try..except helpful to prevent program from crashing but harmful when finding bugs. It would be nice if it could be disabled.<br />
  [cho4] Check which components are still running and which components are not.<br />
<br />
  [jba1] logging engine that can be enable/disable certain components so you can keep the printing of the messages in the code, but it will just not be showed if not wanted.<br />
<br />
</p>
<h2 id="ordering-the-ideas">Ordering the ideas</h2>
<p><br />
Ordering them by functionality, we get:<br />
<br />
</p>
<ul>
<li> [orp1], [orp2], [law1], [cho1] essentially refer to a basic Axon-based testing framework.</li>
<li>[orp3] refers to a cool feature of the testing framework.</li>
<li>[cho4] refers to another cool feature of the testing framework.</li>
</ul>
<p><br />
</p>
<ul>
<li>[dav2] and [jba1] are essentially a logging engine, which may not be part of the testing framework (but it's still interesting since that's the other part of my GSOC project :-D )</li>
<li>[cho2] may be closer to what a debugger would offer, but since even local variables in a generator can be easily retrieved (see <a href="http://pastebin.com/m7a316728">here</a>), it might be interesting to consider it for accessing local variables in the component. This would be really cool, but I will not add it to a first stage.<br />
</li>
<li>[cho3] may use a method "independent of the testing framework" (in order to call something like "self.raiseExceptions" which re-raise the raised exception only if a certain variable is set), although later the testing framework would use that variable, I'm not sure if it's something tied to it.<br />
</li>
<li>[dav1] refers to an interesting feature that may not be integrated in an automated testing framework, although it may be possible through a virtual X server such as Xvfb. I have to give it another thought though.<br />
</li>
</ul>
