<p>Feb 2024 - This site, and Kamaelia are <a href="https://github.com/sparkslabs/kamaelia/issues/15">being updated</a>. There is significant work needed, and <a href="https://github.com/sparkslabs/kamaelia/pulls">PRs</a> are welcome.

<h2 id="kamaelia-publish-open-issues">Kamaelia Publish Open Issues</h2>
<p>This page is intended to be a big "todo" list for Kamaelia Publish.  It may or may not a lot of items that I would like to get done but may not have time for.  So this page shouldn't be construed as being a part of my GSoC work (but some of it will be).<br />
<br />
</p>
<h3 id="bugs">Bugs</h3>
<p>The software still needs much more testing, so this really only represents a list of known bugs:<br />
<br />
</p>
<ul>
<li>When the gateway logs in, sometimes it receives messages indicating which users are online, sometimes it doesn't.  The gateway should check a user's online status with the server before assuming they are offline.<br />
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="enhancements">Enhancements</h3>
<p><del>Make static content able to be served.</del></p>
<ul>
<li>Static content is now served by the gateway.  The peer is capable of serving such files, but such would be REALLY slow and somewhat more complicated.<br />
</li>
</ul>
<p>Add the capability to look up registered and possibly logged in users in a database.</p>
<ul>
<li>Partially completed:  Registered users and whether they are logged in or not can be stored in a SQLite database.</li>
<li>sub-issue:  Get the gateway able to use more different kinds of databases like MySQL, PostgreSQL, etc.</li>
<li>sub-issue:  Having to look up whether or not a user is online EVERY time will probably affect performance.  Some kind of caching system should be in place.<br />
</li>
</ul>
<p>Add the capability to send data between the Gateway and serving peer directly.  This can be done by either doing an XMPP file transfer or possibly bypassing XMPP altogether.</p>
<p>Look into getting the Peer to work on Python 2.2.  Being able to run a webserver on Symbian would be Pretty Damn Cool (tm).</p>
<ul>
<li>This is definitely a "would be nifty" idea.  I have no idea if this is even feasible or how much work would be involved in this.<br />
</li>
</ul>
