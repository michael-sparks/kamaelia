<h2 id="description"><strong>Description</strong></h2>
<p>Compose will be a tool capable of visually composing and editting any Kamaelia system.<br />
<br />
As Compose is created/improved, it will be capable of creating more and more complex Kamaelia based systems visually. The outcome will be a tool for generic systems, but especially networked &amp; multimedia applications.<br />
<br />
The potential for a graphical tool has been recognised all along, and care has been taken in the design of Axon to allow this to happen, and to ensure that any running system structure is introspectable at runtime. Indeed, first came the system, then introspection, then visual creation. Any extensions to the system (eg for non-dataflow components) are suggested to follow the same mould - text/introspectable first, graphical second.<br />
<br />
Benefits:<br />
</p>
<p>A graphical tool provides for rapid prototyping</p>
<p>There is the potential for a generic "spreadsheet of applications"</p>
<p>There is the potential to build versions with a targeted interfaces for different user types:</p>
<ul>
<li>Non-technical BBC users</li>
<li>Technical BBC users</li>
<li>Children</li>
</ul>
<p>As a debugging tool, the ability to visually delve inside a running system and fix things (much like opening the hood of a car) is an extremely interesting prospect - especially if this can be done in a sustainable, maintainable way.<br />
