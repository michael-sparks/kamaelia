<p>March 2024 - This site, and Kamaelia are <a href="https://github.com/sparkslabs/kamaelia/issues/15">being updated</a>. There is significant work needed, and <a href="https://github.com/sparkslabs/kamaelia/pulls">PRs</a> are welcome.

<h2 id="kamaelia-jam">Kamaelia Jam</h2>
<h3 id="what-is-it">What is it?</h3>
<p>Kamaelia Jam is a music sequencer designed to be used simultaneously
by more than one user over a network. It will also act as a toolkit for
quickly prototyping networked music applications.</p>
<h3 id="where-do-i-get-and-install-it">Where do I get and install
it?</h3>
<p><br />
Barely tested pre-alpha packages (marking the end of GSoC '08) can be
downloaded below:<br />
<br />
<a href="http://www.box.net/shared/mle3bl31on">Linux</a> - See INSALL
instructions in the Docs folder<br />
<br />
<a href="http://www.box.net/shared/mpov64vgx0">Windows</a> - Run through
the installer<br />
<br />
</p>
<p>The latest version of jam is available from a branch in svn.
Instructions for installing the dependencies are available <a
href="http://kamaelia.svn.sourceforge.net/viewvc/kamaelia/trunk/Sketches/JT/INSTALL?revision=3916&amp;view=markup">here</a>.<br />

<h3 id="planned-schedule">Planned Schedule</h3>
<p><code>&lt; 6 Jun - Rearrange directory structure, start to look at packaging, sit</code><br />
<code>exams</code><br />
<code>Functionality:</code><br />
<code>Become the proud owner of a degree :)</code><br />
<br />
<code>6 ``Jun`` -Improve and test timing code.  Begin to work out details of</code><br />
<code>extenally controlling components.  Get Matt's modified CSA working with</code><br />
<code>UDP.</code><br />
<code>Functionality:</code><br />
<code>* Basically this week will be mainly setting the groundwork.  The timing</code><br />
<code>code will let me write components which talk nicely and accurately</code><br />
<code>(&lt;1ms) in music timing (beats, bars, bpm etc).</code><br />
<code>* Externally controlling components = getting data from an inbox (the</code><br />
<code>network eventually) to control UI elements.  I think this will take a</code><br />
<code>couple of goes to get right, so start to look at it here.</code><br />
<code>* Modified CSA with UDP.  This will let me receive data over a UDP port</code><br />
<code>without using 100% CPU.</code><br />
<br />
<code>16`` ``Jun`` - Write basic networking code, allowing two users to communicate.</code><br />
<code>Test out network communication, and make strange twiddly noises with</code><br />
<code>someone :)</code><br />
<code>Functionality:</code><br />
<code>* At the end of the week there should be two people at different</code><br />
<code>computers controlling XY pads on each others computers.  As you say this</code><br />
<code>is probably a bit pessimistic timing-wise, but I'm not very hot on</code><br />
<code>networking, so have given a bit of leeway here for me to get up to</code><br />
<code>speed.</code></p>
<h1 id="section"><br />
</h1>
<p><br />
<code>9 ``Jun`` - Various bits of documentation.  Package everything up and test it out.</code><br />
<code>Functionality:</code><br />
<code>* Packaging everything - in the week before I should have got to the</code><br />
<code>point where I have a (albeit unexciting) working networked music app.</code><br />
<code>Seems like a good point to test out packaging - so I should have a</code><br />
<code>working distribution of it for the big three, which can be easily</code><br />
<code>tested.</code><br />
<br />
<code>16 ``Jun`` - Get multiple client networking code working - sort out how having</code><br />
<code>lots of users will work practically.</code><br />
<code>Functionality:</code><br />
<code>* Again, maybe a bit pessimistic.  By the end of the week have a system</code><br />
<code>where multiple users can join in a session and control XY pads.  Again I</code><br />
<code>think this may take a couple of goes to get right practically.</code><br />
<br />
<code>23 Jun - Write the step sequencer</code><br />
<code>Functionality:</code><br />
<code>* Working step sequencer which can be used by as many users as you like.</code><br />
<br />
30
Jun<code>- Write the piano roll (add/delete functionality)</code><br />
<code>Functionality:</code><br />
<code>* Working piano roll, where users can add and delete notes.</code><br />
<br />
<code>7 Jul`` - Extend the piano roll (move/resize functionality)</code><br />
<code>Functionality:</code><br />
<code>* Users will be able to move and resize notes at will - basically a</code><br />
<code>complete network enabled step sequencer</code></p>
<p>14 Jul - Add in various filters to make Jam work with midi out, and
make sure midi component is up to scratch and working.</p>
<p>Functionality:<br />
* A version of Jam which can switch between MIDI and OSC output for
local control<br />
</p>
<p><br />
21
<code>Jul`` - Write "glue" code and fix up details (peer select widget, any</code><br />
<code>extra UI niceness, port/socket configuration etc.)</code><br />
<code>Functionality:</code><br />
<code>* Deliver the above - program should be basically "complete" and ready</code><br />
<code>for packaging here.</code><br />
<br />
28
<code>Jul - Finish off detail, have a look at "extra" components (hopefully)</code><br />
<code>Functionality:</code><br />
<code>* Detail = package it up, make sure everything is well tested, prepare</code><br />
<code>things which need to be merged but haven't, any other stuff which needs</code><br />
<code>doing and I've overlooked :)</code></p>
<p>4 Aug - End - Any overrun fits here. Also work on extra components
(Arduino, Multitouch etc)<br />
</p>
<p>===============================================================<br />
<code>11`` Aug`` - Code cleanup, write documentation and test cases</code><br />
<code>Functionality:</code><br />
<code>* I'll do this as I go along - put this in because Google recommend it</code><br />
<code>as your "pens down" date.  I guess this week can work as a bit of a</code><br />
<code>buffer for overrun, or to sort out any of my extras stuff a bit more.</code></p>
