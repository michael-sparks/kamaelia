<h2 id="description"><strong>Description</strong></h2>
<p>Modifying axon so that components are not scheduled (ie. run) when they are paused. If all components are paused, then the whole Axon system sleeps until woken - it goes quiescent. As it stands, Axon does not do this - the scheduler keeps all microprocesses in a single list and polls all of them continually.<br />
<br />
This is also an "inversion of flow control" - since it enables an Axon based system to become reactive to events, rather than polling.<br />
<br />
Benefits:<br />
</p>
<ul>
<li>General performance and responsiveness improvement - processor cycles will not be wasted on idle microprocesses</li>
<li>Better cooperation with other processes on a computer - Axon based systems will no longer hog processor cycles, even when inactive</li>
</ul>
<p>Needed to make practical high data throughput Kamaelia systems, such as <a href="../../../Developers/Projects/KamaeliaMacro">KamaeliaMacro</a>.<br />

<p>Interested third parties: none<br />
</p>
<p>Requirements</p>
<ul>
<li>MUST cause an Axon system to relinquish the cpu when idle</li>
<li>MUST not change the behaviour of an Axon system from the perspective of individual components</li>
<li>MUST be threadsafe</li>
<li>SHOULD only schedule and run microprocesses that are actually active at a given time (scheduler should properly pause() microprocesses and also unpause() them)</li>
<li>SHOULD not noticeably impact performance</li>
<li>SHOULD be responsive to external stimuli when quiescent (eg. Selector component gets woken when data is available)<br />

<p>Axon's support for the following was removed; and needed to be added back in again:<br />
</p>
<ul>
<li>limited "pipewidths" - linkages that could only carry a limited number of items data before becoming 'full' - (a rate limiting mechanism)<br />
</li>
<li>waking a component when a message leaves on of its outboxes (free space to send to)</li>

<h2 id="discussion">Discussion</h2>
<p>This work mainly centred on modifications to the scheduler - replacing its main loop with on that wouldn't iterate through inactive microprocesses, and providing a thread safe mechanism for submitting requests to it to activate, pause and unpause microprocesses.<br />
<br />
Two variants were experimented on in /Sketches/MH/Inversion. <em>cleverscheduling.py</em> used queues for the pause/unpause/activate requests. <em>aggregatedevents.py</em> attempted to improve efficiency by building a table of changes, rather than simply queuing repeat requests. The former approach was adopted as it was slightly simpler to implement.<br />
<br />
The following components notably underwent substantial overhauls to take advantage of the new quiescence capability, and in some cases, fixing buggy uses of self.pause():<br />
</p>
<ul>
<li>Selector - made into a threaded component that blocked on select calls and would pause when idle</li>
<li>Pipeline/Graphline/Carousel - improved handling for child shutdown on termination</li>
<li>Pygame components - separated event polling into a threaded component to allow pausing when inactive; and modified existing components to explicitly send a request when they need to be redrawn, rather than assuming it happens continuously.</li>
<li>Introspector - new method calls were added to the scheduler for it to use, so it could introspect without knowing too much about the scheduler's internal structure.</li>
</ul>
