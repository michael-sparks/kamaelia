</p>
<p><a href="/Developers/Principles"><strong>Principles</strong></a> that guide Kamaelia's development</p>
<p><a href="/KamaeliaProjectDevelopment.html"><strong>Project Development Process</strong></a> - How we manage code from idea, through development, through to refinement, and system refactoring</p>
<p><a href="/KamaeliaProjectProcesses.html"><strong>Project Management Processes</strong></a> - How we manage basic things like day to day to weekly &amp; bimonthly meetings, such that they're <em>useful</em> to those involved. ie <strong><em>Why</em></strong> we use IRC as much as we do.</p>
<p><a href="/Developers/Contributing"><strong>How to Contribute</strong></a></p>
<p>Coding &amp; Documentaion Guidelines:</p>

</ul>
<p><strong>Things To Do</strong></p>
<p><a href="/Developers/Projects"><strong>Projects</strong></a> - Projects at various stages of development - from idea, through development, through dead ends through to systems that work and can be enhanced.</p>
<p><a href="/Developers/HelpWanted"><strong>Help Wanted</strong></a> - Specific tasks waiting for someone to tackle. This could be as simple as a code review or merge.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="/Developers/Tasks"><strong>Small Tasks Page</strong></a> - These are currently unclaimed, but desireable - this is a subset of Help Wanted really, you can add wishlist ideas for Kamaelia as a whole here.<br />
</li>
</ul>
<p>Keep <a href="/CurrentNews"><strong>Current News</strong></a> and <a href="/CurrentStatus"><strong>Project Status</strong></a> up to date!</p>
<p><a href="/Developers/SpeculativeNewIdeas"><strong>Speculative new ideas</strong></a> are always interesting, and would probably start out as sketches for things which could be useful. Componentising certain sorts of things can be a very useful endevour since they can then be reused with all the other components.<br />
