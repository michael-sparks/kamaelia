<p>Feb 2024 - This site, and Kamaelia are <a href="https://github.com/sparkslabs/kamaelia/issues/15">being updated</a>. There is significant work needed, and <a href="https://github.com/sparkslabs/kamaelia/pulls">PRs</a> are welcome.
</div>
<h1 id="new-ideas">New Ideas ?</h1>
<p>Specutaltive new are always interesting, and would probably start out as sketches for things which could be useful. Componentising certain sorts of things can be a very useful endevour since they can then be reused with all the other components. Kamaelia's architecture was itself once a speculative new idea - it's panned out really quite well, so where would like to see things go next ?<br />
<br />
It's probably worth pulling out ideas from the GSOC pages into here.<br />
<br />
Starter for 10: How could these be intergrated?<br />
</p>
<p><strong>Inference engine integration &amp; componentisation</strong> : <a href="http://pyclips.sourceforge.net/web/" class="uri">http://pyclips.sourceforge.net/web/</a> - <a href="http://pyclips.sourceforge.net/web/">PyCLIPS</a> is an extension module for the <a href="http://python.org/" title="Python Web Site">Python language</a> that embeds full <a href="http://clipsrules.sourceforge.net/" title="CLIPS Web Site">CLIPS</a> functionality in <a href="http://python.org/">Python</a> applications. This means that you can provide <a href="http://python.org/" title="Python Web Site">Python</a> with a strong, reliable, widely used and well documented inference engine.</p>
<p><strong>Neural network systems integration</strong> : <a href="http://leenissen.dk/fann/" class="uri">http://leenissen.dk/fann/</a> - Fast Artificial Neural Network Library is a free open source neural network library, which implements multilayer artificial neural networks in C with support for both fully connected and sparsely connected networks. (<a href="http://leenissen.dk/fann/html/files2/installation-txt.html#Python_Bindings">python bindings</a>)</p>
<p><strong>Common sense engine/systems</strong> : eg <a href="http://web.media.mit.edu/%7Ehugo/conceptnet/">ConceptNet</a> - ConceptNet is a freely available commonsense knowledgebase and natural-language-processing toolkit which supports many practical textual-reasoning tasks over real-world documents right out-of-the-box (without additional statistical training) including topic-jisting, affect-sensing, analogy-making, text summarization, contextual expansion, causal projection, cold document classification. (part of MIT's <a href="http://openmind.media.mit.edu/">common sense</a> <a href="http://openmind.media.mit.edu/Beginners.htm">project</a>)</p>
<p><strong>Axon 2.0</strong> : </p>
<ul>
<li>Make microprocesses and components mixinable.  This way, you can mix and match functionality when implementing pieces of a Kamaelia/Axon system.  <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/kamaelia/browse_thread/thread/57602d58e050ebc4">Mail thread</a></li>
<li>Implement sub-graphlines (better name needed!) as a way to make creating and linking subcomponents less tedious and more human readable.  <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/kamaelia/t/8c0eabd1e3ea498b">Mail thread</a><br />
</li>
</ul>
<p>etc :)</p>
<p>(add more!)<br />
