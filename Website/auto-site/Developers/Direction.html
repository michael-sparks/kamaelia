<p>March 2024 - This site, and Kamaelia are <a href="https://github.com/sparkslabs/kamaelia/issues/15">being updated</a>. There is significant work needed, and <a href="https://github.com/sparkslabs/kamaelia/pulls">PRs</a> are welcome.

<h2 id="project-direction-goals-and-mission">Project Direction, Goals,
and Mission</h2>
<h2 id="mission">Mission</h2>
<blockquote>
<p><em>"To make software systems as capable, manipulable and future
proof as the best in science fiction, without waiting 4 centuries, using
concurrency as a tool to make them easier and more natural"<br />
</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>OK, this is a recent change, and needs to change again, but is
slightly less cheesy than:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Kamaelia is an open source project that has as it's less than obvious
goal creating the computer systems that you'd find on next gen version
of the USS Enterprise, just not waiting 4 centuries for it.<br />
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And definitely less teeth jarring than:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>"To do for software systems what IKEA has done for furniture, and
spreadsheets have done for traditional business, but for the BBC's
business of story telling &amp; distribution."</em><br />
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This reflects the fact the project lead works at, and Kamaelia
originated at the BBC.<br />
</p>
<h2 id="practical-goals">Practical Goals</h2>
<p>In concrete terms this mission means:</p>
<p><strong><em>Kamaelia systems should be creatable, eventually, by a
user with a similar level of ease as using a
speadsheet</em></strong>.<br />
Why? This would make it a much more creative tool, and useful for the
average non-programmer in a creative environment, where they don't need
to wait for a programmer to help them envisage their goal. Our <a
href="/Compose/">Compose</a> tool is beginning to push capabilities
upwards.<br />
</p>
<p><strong><em>Kamaelia needs to support the various ways stories can be
told and distributed</em></strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Either through creation of subsystems, or better - by integrating
external best of breed systems where possible.<br />
</li>
</ul>
<!-- -->
<ul>
<li>This includes tools for manipulation of traditional content (audio,
video) from traditional sources (cameras, broadcast, files) as well as
user interfaces (traditional, modern, games 2/3D, web), etc</li>
<li>This implies that networking systems must be adaptable &amp;
malleable. Furthermore it means that any and all online distribution
mechanisms need to be explored for suitability, preferably through
integration in subsystem form.<br />
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><em>Kamaelia</em></strong> must <strong><em>work for the
average programmer as well as the uber-programmer.</em></strong><br />
Given the goal of parallelism this is unsual. In order is to allow the
non-programmer to use their systems, subsystems must <em>inherently</em>
and <em>easily</em> be able to be used/created in this way. Not as a
bolt on, or odious, but because it naturally falls out of the way the
system works.<br />
</p>
<p><strong><em>Systems should be future proofed - this is our starting
point, driving many design decisions</em></strong><br />
In practical terms, hardware is (finally, as long predicted) going
multicore and parallel. Parallel systems programming is currently
considered hard. Kamaelia aims to make concurrent/parallel systems as
simple as possible from a maintenance perspective. <em>Kamaelia's
approach comes from this perspective, however it is part of a larger
picture.</em><br />
</p>
<p><strong><em>This all needs to be as cross platform as
possible</em></strong></p>
<p>Kamaelia 0.5.0 seems to point that these goals are achievable.<br />
<br />
</p>
<h2 id="project-direction">Project Direction</h2>
<p>Concrete, ongoing aspects of the project that show direction:<br />
</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="../../../Compose/">Compose</a>: To build and extend
graphical tools for creating software systems.</li>
<li><a href="../../../Docs/Axon">Axon</a>: To make software created now
relevant in the future - this means making concurrency actually
usable.</li>
<li><a href="../../../Whiteboard/">Whiteboard</a>: To build the tools
that are repurposable, that are networked distribution tools in their
own right, and are useful for collaboration, communicators and
storytellers</li>
</ul>
<p>The project is typically driven by projects and aims originating
inside the BBC. This is then used to stimulate development of both those
projects &amp; Kamaelia itself. You are welcome to do the same.<br />
The current project direction is aimed at improving the toolset to allow
high quality realtime efficient communication and collaboration, whilst
extracting useful subsystems that can reused in novel ways, along with
consolidating existing work for reusability. As a result tools
enabling</p>
<p>High quality audio &amp; video capture</p>
<p>Audio/video manipulation</p>
<p>Integration with common systems &amp; tools (eg Databases, XML,
RSS/Atom sources/sinks)</p>
<p>Tools for organisation of materials for collaboration</p>
<p>Areas which can be enhanced</p>
<ul>
<li>Graphline editors - such as compose or the nascent 360 degree
tool</li>
<li>AV capture</li>
<li>Pygame &amp; Open GL support</li>
<li>Protocols for communicating data as well as control information
across the network (both obvious and non obvious)</li>
</ul>
<p>Are all of interest, but preferably driven by real world problems.
This list is non-exhaustive.<br />
</p>
<h2 id="eh">Eh?</h2>
<p>I know, I know. Very american, very un-european. Sorry :) Some of it
grates for me as much as you, but it's useful to know what we're doing
and why? I hope :-)</p>
<p>Knowing where the developers are headed or being lead is useful to
know. See "Eh?" below if you find this page painful! If you're
interested in developing Kamaelia, please take a peek at <a
href="Visions">Visions of Kamaelia</a>, and add your thoughts.<br />
</p>
<p>What do we mean by Mission, Goals, Direction above?<br />
</p>
<p>A mission is essentially one vision from <a href="Visions">Visions of
Kamaelia</a>, based on the project leads' view. Goals are wider in scope
and can support that mission or any of the other <a
href="Visions">Visions of Kamaelia</a>. Project Direction reflects
current developer priorities. New developers will bring their own
priorities. The mission currently reflects that the project lead works
at, and the project originated at the BBC. There is no expectation that
you share these aims, visions or goals. Sharing your personal vision
expands the project, benefitting everyone.</p>
