<p><strong>Background on Project Task Pages</strong><br />
<br />
Project Task Pages (PTPs) take a standard format, and recognise that feature dev, bug fix, and any other task have commonalities. PTP's aim to capture this information to make it easier to see what's going on, and assign priorities. PTP's as a result have a <a href="/Developers/Projects/ProjectTaskPageTemplate.html">template format</a>, which is based on the way Kamaelia itself is designed.<br />
<br />
A project task page may cover a project as small as a single feature of a single component of a single module, or something as large as an entire application comprisig of several systems. The key aspect here is that each of those subsystems would also have project task pages, as and when they become necessary.<br />
<br />
As a result Kamaelia development and management of components should naturally reflect the component system itself.<br />
<br />
<strong>PTPs to be fleshed out</strong><br />
<br />
Each project here will gain its own page as soon as practical - this is a capture of current state. (This does mean also that there SHOULD be a PTP for ch of the tools listed above)<br />

<p>Challenges Related - It's worth noting that as Kamaelia matures in scope, it's capabilities are beginning to branch out well beyond these challenges<br />

</ul>
<p>Thins that aren't appropriate as project task pages here:<br />
</p>
<ul>
<li>Moore's Law Growing both sides of an equation doesn't help - <a href="http://dirac.sourceforge.net/">The Dirac project</a> is largely aimed at dealing with these, and is outside the scope of Kamaelia</li>
</ul>
<!-- -->
<ul>
<li>Open - This relates to the fact that open systems need to be able to scale. This is inherently Kamaelia's core goal regarding online delivery.<br />
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="section"></h3>
<p>Projects are to be labelled with tags to help classify and organise them. We've chosen this over having a predefined url based hierarchical structure as it gives greater flexibility and acknowledges the fact that projects will change in status and scope over time.</p>
<p>Possible tags to us include:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Experimental</em> (for stuff in /Sketches)<br />
</li>
<li><em>Tool</em> (typically the kind of thing that ends up in /Kamaelia/Tools)<br />
</li>
<li><em>Example</em> (pieces of code that exist to demonstrate functionality)*<br />

<ul>
<li></li>
</ul></li>
<li>Mainline (work affecting the main /Code codebase)<br />
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="tools">Tools</h2>
<p>These are relatively substantial systems in their own right. Their development, and components driving their development are ongoing.<br />
</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="/Compose/"><strong>Compose</strong></a> - a tool for composing (creating) Kamaelia systems <em>graphically</em><br />
</li>
<li><a href="/Whiteboard/"><strong>Whiteboard</strong></a> - a tool for collaboration<br />
</li>
<li><a href="/KamaeliaMacro.html"><strong>Macro</strong></a> - tools for timeshifting</li>
<li><a href="/MobileReframer.html"><strong>Mobile Reframer</strong></a> - tool for applying edit decision lists to video for use with mobiles.</li>
<li><a href="/MulticastRtpMpegRemultiplexer.html"><strong>Multicast RTP MPEG TS remultiplexer</strong></a> - tools for remultiplexing and rebroadcasting mpeg transport streams over multicast</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="summer-of-code-2006-project-ideas"><strong>Summer of Code 2006 Project Ideas</strong></h3>
<p>Each of the ideas here have been fleshed out to some degree to or another and are considered useful to differing degrees. If you're looking for a project worth doing, these are worth looking at for ideas. Aside from anything else if we've added them here there's a good chance that they've had some serious thought behind them already, bootstrapping your idea!<br />
<br />
The following list contains the aggregated projects grouped under like for like ideas. <em>The order of projects here has no significance</em></p>
<ul>
<li><a href="/Projects/Soc2006/AVCodecs.html">AV Codec Support</a></li>
<li><a href="/Projects/Soc2006/GeneralisedEventsBackplane.html">Generalised Events Backplane</a><br />
</li>
<li><a href="/Projects/Soc2006/XML2DInterfaces.html">XML Pygame Interface definition and CSS based styling</a><br />
</li>
<li><a href="/Projects/Soc2006/OpenGLWidgets.html">Open GL</a></li>
<li><a href="/Projects/Soc2006/BitTorrent.html">Integrated Bit Torrent Reimplementation</a><br />
</li>
<li><a href="/Projects/Soc2006/CodelessComposition.html">Primitives - Components for codeless composition</a></li>
<li><a href="/Projects/Soc2006/PeerToPeerStreaming.html">Peer-to-Peer streaming architecture using Kamaelia</a></li>
<li><a href="/Projects/Soc2006/DistributedPhysics.html">Distributed physics</a></li>
<li><a href="/Projects/Soc2006/VisualEditor.html">Kamaelia Visual Editor, Graphical IDE</a> - This is similar, but more ambitious in scope than Compose<br />
</li>
<li><a href="/Projects/Soc2006/OHKamaelia.html">OH-Kamaelia (<strong><em>O</em></strong>DMRP based Ad <strong><em>H</em></strong>oc extensions to <em>Kamaelia</em>)</a><br />
</li>
</ul>
<p>One of the most interesting aspects of this list of projects is that many of them were proposed by undergraduate students, and all thought they could achieve these projects over a 3 month coding period, most of them after having done the <a href="/MiniAxon/">MiniAxon</a> tutorial.<br />
</p>
<h3 id="completed-summer-of-code-2006-projects"><strong>Completed Summer of Code 2006 Projects</strong></h3>
<p>In some cases these were exploratory, some were concrete, some were half way. All were useful for different reasons.<br />
