<p>Feb 2024 - This site, and Kamaelia are <a href="https://github.com/sparkslabs/kamaelia/issues/15">being updated</a>. There is significant work needed, and <a href="https://github.com/sparkslabs/kamaelia/pulls">PRs</a> are welcome.
</div>
<h1 id="recent-changes">Recent Changes</h1>
<p><strong>Current status:</strong> This site is currently undergoing a number of updates and upgrades. After this the plan is to bring the Kamaelia codebase up to date relative to changes in the python eco system since the project was put on indefinite hold.</p>
<p><strong>Why?</strong> This was a relative safe thing to do when the project was targetting python 2.7 since python 2.7 was an extraordinarily long lived supported version. Then the pandemic hit, and frankly, there were more important things to worry about. The pandemic is still with us, but circumstances have changed, making updates at the moment practical and realistic to achieve, so this has been done.</p>
<h2 id="upcoming-changes">Upcoming changes</h2>
<p>In no particular order:</p>
<ul>
<li>Replacement of developer section - which was targetted at community engagement with a better user-developer targetted section. This would build on the existing docs around tutorials, cookbooks and API reference etc</li>
<li>Template fixes</li>
<li>Content fixes, content refresh</li>
<li>Code updates, guild tests</li>
<li>Rebuild of auto-doc system</li>
<li>Re-enable the quiz form of the mini-axon tutorial</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="future">Future</h2>
<ul>
<li>Actor-Flow.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="section">2024/02/11</h2>
<p>(This page created today, adding some entries and dates below for an indication of activity)</p>
<p>Over the past 2 months, on and off, work has been done on the following areas to start bringing this site back up to speed:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Auto-API documentation generation has been rebooted. The <a href="https://github.com/sparkslabs/kamaelia/tree/master/Code/Python/Kamaelia/Tools/NewDocGen">new tools</a> have been added to the <a href="https://github.com/sparkslabs/kamaelia">github repo</a> (<a href="https://github.com/sparkslabs/kamaelia/pull/11/files">2023/12/24</a>)</p></li>
<li><p>In order to do this, there needed to be a whole load of python 3 related fixes (<a href="https://github.com/sparkslabs/kamaelia/pull/8/files">2023/12/16</a>). There still need to be a bunch of fixes related to changes in the python ecosystem. This especially included the removal of wildcard imports within the repo (<a href="https://github.com/sparkslabs/kamaelia/pull/9/files">2023/12/21</a>), along with other minor fixes (<a href="https://github.com/sparkslabs/kamaelia/pull/10/files">2023/12/24</a>)</p></li>
<li><p>The PDF of these docs are linked from the <a href="/Home.html">Home page</a> - This is essentially a complete book level reference text which can accompany the tutorial written previously. (<a href="https://github.com/sparkslabs/kamaelia/pull/12/files">2023/12/24</a>)</p></li>
<li><p><a href="https://github.com/sparkslabs/kamaelia/issues/14">SSL/TLS has been enabled</a> on the Kamaelia website</p></li>
<li><p>The ancient wiki engine which was used to manage this site, and never quite made the jump between server hosts, was temporarily resurrected offline, and used to create an unstyled, "no furniture" version of the site. This is all part of the <a href="https://github.com/sparkslabs/kamaelia/pull/16">site revamp</a></p></li>
<li><p>Slideshare embeds fixed for presentations and tutorials</p></li>
<li><p>This has allowed the site to be switched to being (almost entirely) generated from markdown files <a href="https://github.com/sparkslabs/kamaelia/pull/16">2024/2/4</a>, making it easier to edit. (This still in part a WIP)</p>
<ul>
<li>This uses pandoc to generate the HTML, and then that is styled using new CSS. This allows better/nicer autostyling of source code where enabled.</li>
<li>Some initial metadata has also been added, some for pandoc, but primarily to allow improved site management (rather than manglement)</li>
<li>Added some links back to the RD Website</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Significant chunks of <a href="https://github.com/sparkslabs/kamaelia/issues/7">breakage on the website have been fixed</a>. (Started 23/12/15, issue closed on 2024/02/03) This includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Removal of old site infrastructure that no longer makes sense.
<ul>
<li>For example, the <a href="/Sitemap.html">site map</a> has been removed from page links. The reason for this:
<ul>
<li>While the links have been fixed on that page, not all the links should be there</li>
<li>Lots of the content linked to is stale, and removing the link from general pages gives a chance to update and rename it</li>
<li>It has links to old wiki infrastructure that no longer exist.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Same goes for the site infrastructure links to the ancient wiki.</li>
<li>Removal of the old automated "Recent Changes" page because it made it look like it was automated, but the wiki engine used to do that went away a long time ago</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Fixes to lots of links - like in the cookbook</li>
<li>The CSS is now a lot leaner, simpler and cleaner. (It could be better and more responsive, but that'll wait for an overall redesign)</li>
<li>Links to pages that said "this will be written shortly" removed as have been many placeholders.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>A number of key things that need updating have been captured in a github project.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="before-20231215">Before 2023/12/15</h2>
<p>The project was on hold in a "the things we're using aren't broken so this isn't being updated" state. Kamaelia had been used in a number of small projects internally while the project was in this state, but there were few public updates.</p>
<p>There were minor fixes to the DVB subsystems (2016).</p>
<h2 id="guild">2014-2022 - Guild</h2>
<p>Most effort in this space has actually gone into Kamaelia's follow on project <a href="https://github.com/sparkslabs/guild">Guild</a> which focussed on a "syntactic sugar" first approach. Guild was not heavility advertised, but was used internally in a number of projects. For example it was used in the micro:bit prototype to implement the <a href="https://github.com/sparkslabs/microbit-prototype/blob/master/compiler/batch_compiler.py">batch compiler</a> in the python to arduino-C++ <a href="https://github.com/sparkslabs/microbit-prototype/tree/master/compiler">toolchain</a>. To give an idea of timeframe of activity there:</p>
<ul>
<li>2014 - Guild first released as a public project (after use with internal project)</li>
<li>2014/2015 - Guild used in production system to manage compilation of user programs in the micro:bit prototype</li>
<li>2015 - basic STM added, support for actor functions, actor exceptions, alongside actor methods, various examples</li>
<li>2017 - Python 3 related updates, usability tweaks based on use in systems.</li>
<li>2019 - Experiments around pygame actors</li>
<li>2021 - Usability tweaks, based on use in an internal system.</li>
<li>2022
<ul>
<li>Internal tweaks and cleanups (again based on internal usage), removed python 2 support</li>
<li>Examples improved (esp using pygame as a core example)</li>
<li>Initial version of a promises API (which allows concurrent actor_function calls and handling as they return) - including job cancellation</li>
<li>Added <a href="https://github.com/sparkslabs/guild/commit/04d7d03f0551bf81179baa08e3155f330172df06">Mini-Guild</a> - based on <a href="/MiniAxon.html">Mini-Axon</a> in Kamaelia, which was then fleshed out to a more complete <a href="https://github.com/sparkslabs/guild/tree/master/examples/blog/miniguild">miniguild</a></li>
<li>Initial C++ Guild tests</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>Future work on Kamaelia will probably relate to bringing the best ideas from Guild into Kamaelia and allowing the use of Kamaelia components in guild systems.</p>
<h2 id="why-mention-guild-and-resurrect-kamaelia">Why mention Guild and resurrect Kamaelia?</h2>
<p><em>This section needs editting down, or perhaps shifting off to a blog</em></p>
<p><strong>Why mention Guild here?</strong> While this is the Kamaelia site, not the guild one, guild was very much intended as a follow on from Kamaelia. It's intention was very much "OK, we've proven that can work, can we make it work with a nice syntax?". As a result, Guild started from a "syntactic sugar first" approach, but the aim was always to unify the two projects. This never actually happened, but probably will at some point.</p>
<p>To cut a long story short, I figured out a way of doing a guild type syntax in C++. From a kamaelia perspective a C++ version has always been possible. This was first demonstrated in a <a href="https://github.com/sparkslabs/kamaelia/blob/master/Code/CPP/Scratch/miniaxon.readme">C++ MiniAxon</a> from as long ago as Feb 2005. I recently benchmarked the generators that used relative to C++20 coroutines, and found that <a href="http://www.sparkslabs.com/blog/posts/coroutines-5-benchmarking-cpp03-cpp20-python-generators.html">ancient code was remarkably good</a>.</p>
<p>Also, since starting Guild, I've become increasingly aware that actually formally publishing this stuff would be useful. For example, this approach of having <strong>outboxes</strong> - which was first in Kamaelia, and then reused in Guild actually seems pretty unique, especially from the perspective of seeking to simplify development for novice users. This was noted by Ted Leung in an <a href="https://www.slideshare.net/twleung/a-survey-of-concurrency-constructs">O'Reilly keynote in back in 2009</a>.</p>
<p>The point being though, Kamaelia isn't really a CSP system (which to an extent inspired Kamaelia though async hardware &amp; network systems were the core). This point was raised at an early Pycon UK and the person noting it said "you're doing actor systems". At the time I didn't know an awful lot about actor systems, so I went away, and thought "maybe I can use that idea for syntactic sugar"</p>
<p>So that inspired Guild. Kamaelia was put on hold for various reasons, but primarily because I noted that while begineers could start, get up to speed with kamaelia and do interesting things, there was a reticence from experienced developers. I figured then that syntactic sugar was the way forward. Then life got busy and we all got allocated to different projects.</p>
<p>Kamaelia pretty much sought to ask the question "can you build systems like this?" Guild pretty much sought to ask the question "Can you make this readable and friendlier to experienced developers?" My current question is "can I generalise this across different languages and gain significant performance gains, and later down the line interoperability?".</p>
<p>Then I realised that I could implement Guild like sugar in modern C++ and I got re-interested. This time I did a literature search (ACM, Springer, etc) to see if anyone had done this. To my surprise, no.</p>
<ul>
<li>Actor systems were/are very much stuck with the <code>address -&gt;  process+mailbox</code> model. There's literally hundreds of variants on this model, but they all boil down to this. This means the late binding you get with outboxes (even as a metaphor) simple doesn't exist as a systemic thing.</li>
<li>Flow based systems - which are very Kamaelia like - also don't tend to look at things in this way.</li>
<li>The thing that people didn't like about Kamaelia - the matching for messages - which tends to map to an if or switch statement - is the default in the actor world.</li>
<li>There was a <em>language</em> - Thal - written as part of a thesis that had Guild's concept of actor methods, but not really actor methods or exceptions, and no concept of late binding.</li>
<li>Most systems try to be "pure" actor models, and avoid secondary forms of concurrency, even though this sort of thing is necessary to avoid convoluated code in real world code. (Such as STM - which underlies the CAT in Kamaelia, and is a core piece of functionality in Guild.)</li>
<li>Nesting and pipelining ala Kamaelia and guild seems rare.</li>
</ul>
<p>Please note though, there are some really awesome things in the actor world at the moment, and the two that spring to mind are Pony and Akka. If you’re interested in looking at actors more, those are great starting points. There are also a number of high performance actor systems in languages like C++, but I personally feel that readability and ease of use are vital. (And those two "soft" aspects don't tend to apply to languages like C++ :-) - and I use C++ daily as well as python these days...)</p>
<p><strong>Why resurrect Kamaelia?</strong> The upshot from this, is that I thought "this all needs formally publishing and talking about", primarily because I've now got code over 20 years old that is still useful today <em>because</em> of Kamaelia's separation of concerns.</p>
<p>Yes, Kamaelia could do with a root and branch update. Many subsystems could do with Guild style rewrites, but the code and systems tend to just <em>work</em>. The core version of <a href="/KamaeliaGrey.html">Kamaelia Grey</a> - the greylisting server that handled my email <em>for over a decade</em> (until I abandoned running my home sever) was <em>written in an afternoon,</em> and tweaked over a few days following.</p>
<p>The point is this combination of flow and actors hasn't really been talked about in the literature, as far as I can tell. Not in the way used in Kamaelia and Guild and not really from the perspective of ease of use, and clarity of systems. So publishing struck me as a good idea.</p>
<p>That led me to revisiting fixing the Kamaelia site, and leads me to rethinking interoperability between the two - especially given the changes in the python language since Kamaelia started.</p>
