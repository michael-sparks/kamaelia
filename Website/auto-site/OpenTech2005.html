<p>Feb 2024 - This site, and Kamaelia are <a href="https://github.com/sparkslabs/kamaelia/issues/15">being updated</a>. There is significant work needed, and <a href="https://github.com/sparkslabs/kamaelia/pulls">PRs</a> are welcome.
</div>
<p><span style="font-size:20pt;font-weight:600">Kamaelia @ OpenTech 2005</span></p>
<p>Open Tech 2005* is a follow on from previous years' NotCon events which are community driven low cost events by geeks &amp; developers for geeks &amp; developers. (Much like Pycon &amp; Europython but much more general in nature)</p>
<ul>
<li>Website: <a href="http://www.ukuug.org/events/opentech2005/" class="uri">http://www.ukuug.org/events/opentech2005/</a></li>
<li>Where/When: Hammersmith, London, UK, July 23rd</li>
</ul>
<p>The reason I'm posting about it is because I'm going to be talking about Kamaelia there. Unlike Python UK &amp; Europython this is going to be a 15 minute talk, so I'll be focussing on what we've been doing with Kamaelia, what you can do with Kamaelia, and so on rather than going through internals.</p>
<p>In addition since my talk on Kamaelia is before lunch, I'd really like to help people get started using Kamaelia (this really the point of giving talks!), so I'm going to be running a small ad-hoc/mini sprint that afternoon.</p>
<p>There's a variety of possible sprintable things ranging from <a href="http://kamaelia.sourceforge.net/cgi-bin/blog/blog.cgi?rm=viewpost&amp;postid=1113495151">how to put together simple Kamaelia systems</a> through to using <a href="http://cvs.sourceforge.net/viewcvs.py/kamaelia/Code/Python/Axon/Platforms/Series60/">Kamaelia on Nokia Series 60 mobiles</a> through to using <a href="http://cvs.sourceforge.net/viewcvs.py/kamaelia/Sketches/OptimisationTest/">Kamaelia for writing games</a> (since we have some nice <a href="http://cvs.sourceforge.net/viewcvs.py/kamaelia/Code/Python/Kamaelia/Kamaelia/UI/">Pygame based components</a> now).</p>
<p>I'll probably be sprinting on converting a proof of concept P2P swarming algorithm into a protocol for creating TCP server swarms. This is for joining together multicast islands to make it so that internet broadcasting, rather than narrowcasting, can become a reality for the BBC - which has clear benefits for everyone! (Even though the internet is not TV :)</p>
<p>Kamaelia is designed to be able to picked up relatively quickly/easily, but having a working knowledge of python is probably a necessity.</p>
<p>If you're interested, please let <a href="mailto:michaels@rd.bbc.co.uk">me</a> know! (Either before, or at Open Tech :)</p>
<p><span style="font-weight:600">Original Proposal to Open Tech Organisers</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400">Kamaelia - Taking back the pipeline</span></p>
<p>Kamaelia is a project from BBC R&amp;D that is aimed at building next generation systems, software and protocols for next generation hardware. That means high levels concurrency, and we need it to be easy. Whilst Kamaelia is supporting the goal of putting as much BBC content online as possible, its core technology holds promise to make concurrency simple FUN and natural to work with, by giving Unix pipelines a 2,3/n-D twist and weaving a new web with them. Tools exist for making TCP/Multicast servers, clients, visual games, physics simulations, audio playback and more. This talk will focus on the general ideas and use as a taster, and we would also like to hold a sprint afterwards for anyone interested in learning more.</p>
<p><span style="font-style:italic">15 minutes (though longer - up to 45 minutes would be well used)</span></p>
